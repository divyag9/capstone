it is still a lot of money for a Chromebook .
while the pixel book though is a nice device
it is a phone or pedestrian computer than anything Google has released thus far .
it is a basic looking clamshell laptop with a 13.3 inch 1080p touchscreen and a black paint job unmarked except for a small Google Gee logo in the corner of the lid
it is thicker than that device still weighs about the same at 2.3 pounds .
it is glass
there is one new funky design flourish to be found
it is ridged underside
still it is good to see Google 's more playful side on this otherwise dull laptop and while the goal might be a little boring .
it is much heavier than the go for example
as such there are some other notable changes to the go compared to its predecessor
it is not a convertible so tablet mode .
it is just not nearly as gorgeous to look at as those last two computers 1080p on a 13.3 inch screen .
that option is only available if you get a top - of - the - line model which costs an eye - popping thirteen hundred and ninety nine dollars
the good news is that the go as much slimmer bezels around the screen than the original pixel book .
the go is almost as good .
they are pretty quiet Google about the whole thing right here .
the trackpad under their hand is just fine .
scrolling around is not as smooth .
it is not bad .
which is frustrating
that Android apps on Chrome are not usually worth using if there 's a web - based alternative overall
it is a worthwhile upgrade for anyone
which is a definite improvement over the first pixel book
the pixel book go is a much easier device to evaluate than either the first pixel book or the pixel
it is a standard familiar almost boring laptop .
the go is just a straightforward no - frills device .
it is still not particularly cheap especially if you step up to the i5 processor
