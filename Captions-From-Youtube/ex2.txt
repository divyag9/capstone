it's Google pixel for day and of course as you should know we've got every single version sitting in front of me this every single version right well okay so it's the for excel in the three different colors they always got fancy names for the colors a clearly white oh so orange just black and so we have the Excel versions on the top and then below that you wouldn't know from the size of the box but we have the standard size pixel for some specifications for each here the XL 6.3 inch display 128 gigs of storage on this particular model the non XL version pixel for 5.7 inch display this is fresh it's hot off the presses so this video it's just it's an unboxing video and a first-look type of video just keep that in mind f HD Plus flexible OLED 444 PPI and then qhd+ so a higher pixel density on the XL at 5:37 DPI Gorilla Glass 5 on both oh they're gonna have 90 Hertz smooth displays you know that kind of quickie buttery what about a milkshake yeah is that smooth not bad the little guy is 2,800 milliamp hours at the big one 3700 both 18 watt fast charging and wireless charging and then of course a big thing near the cameras the brand new design on the back now they're like no we're gonna give you the versatility of multiple camera lenses white pixel for excel and the first thing you're gonna notice here a similar effect to the Panda version white on the back but then you get the black cutout for the cameras you get the black Ridge on the frame this is all metal and then the entire front of the device is black so it's a panda effect black and white I think a lot of people I think some people gonna like that mmm-hmm a USB type-c cable as well as a USB adapter and then this is the aforementioned power brick with the quick charge capability that's also orange this is for the for those that want to make more of a statement that's obviously a look I should also mention at this point it's a glass back it's a matte finish it's not a glossy finish oh yeah you're right it is glossy so on the black version the power switch is going to be this white color and on the other two versions actually and then on the orange phone it gets a little bit lighter in color that's yeah interesting choices here this is a very simple look to it but of course with any glossy finish you're opening yourself up to finger prints and so forth so you guys decide it looks fancy though this form factor is gonna be familiar to you it's a very practical utility more than anything easier to hold yes will he do ladies and gentlemen this is the small one I'll just place that there's your comparison right there big and small I'm gravitating towards this color there we go put that guy right on top I look down okay [Music] I notice straightaway here that the emphasis unlike a lot of other smartphone makers is not on screen to body ratio they're they're cool with having a forehead a chin on the device not overwhelmingly slim bezels a lot of that has to do with packing extra tech into the top forehead section of the device to NIR cameras dot projector flood emitter a camera as well with a 90 degree field of view fixed focus the pixel 4 &amp; 4 XL are now exclusively face on lock no fingerprint on the back no fingerprint in the display face unlock is enough and I guess they believe that's the future going forward with this degree of technology being baked in and giving up so much in the screen to body ratio department they've got to be cool with it and think that's the way to go so let's go ahead and give it a give it a test I'm going to scan my face in here he's locked phone unlocked phone locked phone unlocked phone I mean you just have to commit more space to have the extra tech built-in but you get you get stuff like the ability to illuminate the face in darker environments which if face unlock is going to be the only unlock available exclusively you kind of need that we can load up the front-facing camera real quick now you get the extra camera on the back and the singular camera on the front so it's a it's a switch obviously you have portrait you have night sight built-in all right this is a fresh device it's possibly not even final software number two all right so within the options of course you can configure the amount of processing that takes place this is with some of the natural face stuff turned off we have an abundance of boxes here so let's give that a quick shot as you can see here you get the wider look or you can move in a little bit closer let's try a 4x zoom I mean it's interesting because in the preview you can actually see some of the noise and stuff that you would traditionally have with a digitally zoomed image but then in the finished product the software runs such a process on it it eliminates all of that you can see a couple of cutouts on the bottom presumably for your speaker and microphone as well as your type-c connector interestingly in the spec sheet it lists a nano-sim or an e sim configurability alright so since we have the two displays stacked up I think that's gonna be an interesting characteristic for a lot of people mostly because they've added 90 Hertz to it now so what that means for people that are unfamiliar is you get this really twitchy kind of input really responsive field in fact it makes the entire phone feel faster alright maybe we should play a video let's just compare the speakers on the two units here I've got one of these surface laptop threes coming in well you didn't know that Jack caught you off-guard you know that a significant amount of sound is coming out of two different ports substantial sound from each area it's more volume than you might be used to out of the both of them balanced let's compare it to the little phone it all sounds very good on paper of course the marketplace will wait but talking a lot recently about trying to nail down the perfect laptop it's a real mission of mine so the larger than usual forehead there's also sensors in there capable of motion tracking tracking of a hand gestures Google's calling it motion sense because this software is early I can't showcase it to you at the moment but it's another trade-off I mean you're packing in some extra hardware for the potential to interact with your device without touching it beyond just assistant in your voice now potentially I'm scrolling and swiping without even touching it on the final version of the software it's also important to know I mean with the pixel devices in general it means you're getting the latest software that means you're getting features first including the latest when it comes to assistant ok Google what is unbox therapy and you can see the way that its installed the way that it's implemented is different than it used to be a lot happens now right within the main screen so you don't jump over to a different app in order to engage it and of course the advanced version of that is the continuation of conversation which is the initial instruction and then the deeper dive with assistant understanding context so you want to say okay Google hey Siri merely is often I think the biggest takeaway here is going to be Google moving towards 90 Hertz display for one and then secondary it's going to be camera performance eventually on final software what it's capable of from a computational perspective that's every single one on box as I mentioned this is just a first-look type of video I'll have a follow-up today's pixel day it just came out so you have two clearly white excel oh I should also mention that oh so orange is apparently limited edition so if you're interested I don't know what you guys do line up get your order in go black version which is the only glossy one of the bunch if that's what you're into polished fancy type of lifestyle you can go for that look as well I think I'm leaning towards this one right
