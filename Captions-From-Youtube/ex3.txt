Google has been building its own Chromebooks for a while now first there were two iterations of the Chromebook pixel and then there was 2017 pixel book all three worked great laptops with one huge flaw they cost way too much money Google's back at it again this year with the new pixel book go and for the first time Google's not trying to make the best Chromebook ever price be damned [Music] instead Google is trying to build a Chromebook that anyone can use and afford the pixel will go starts at six hundred and fifty dollars a full 350 less than the original pixel book it's still a lot of money for a Chromebook but for the first time Google's built something better than the cheap low-end Chromebooks out there that still semi affordable unfortunately in its quest to get the price down Google also second rest a lot of what made the original pixel looks so intriguing in the first place but for a lot of people those trade-offs will be worth it all of Google's previous Chromebooks as well as last year's ill-fated pixel slate tablet had distinctive designs and premium hardware with very few corners cut while the pixel book though is a nice device it's a phone or pedestrian computer than anything Google has released thus far it's a basic looking clamshell laptop with a 13.3 inch 1080p touchscreen and a black paint job unmarked except for a small Google Gee logo in the corner of the lid it also comes in very light pink with a bright coral underside a much more distinctive combo but the all-black has a certain understated elegance either way the go feels sturdy and well built but doesn't have any of the distinctive design elements you'll see in the original pixel book it's thicker than that device still weighs about the same at 2.3 pounds I definitely miss the aesthetics of the original though particularly it's glass an aluminum lid that echoed the design of goulds pixel phones the go as a functional utilitarian design which I can appreciate but I wish it was slightly more exciting there is one new funky design flourish to be found the pixel book go it's ridged underside for whatever reason pictures made me think that this was a different softer material than the magnesium that makes up the rest of the goes case but it doesn't feel any different than the rest of the device google says it design needs word just to make the laptop easier to grip or pull out of a sleeve but I can't have had any problems handling other computers still it's good to see Google's more playful side on this otherwise dull laptop and while the goal might be a little boring it still feels nicer and sturdier than almost any other Chromebook on the market the otherwise excellent Asus Chromebook flip that I reviewed earlier this year it's much heavier than the go for example Google's surely simplified its design as a way to cut costs and as such there are some other notable changes to the go compared to its predecessor unlike the first pixel book it's not a convertible so tablet mode is out that also means it doesn't work with the pixel book pen stylus both the pixel book in the pixel slate at excellent displays with a taller aspect ratio and higher resolutions in the pixel book go and I'm a little sad to see the step back and display quality here that's not to say the Dell has a bad screen it's just not nearly as gorgeous to look at as those last two computers 1080p on a 13.3 inch screen works out to 166 pixels per inch a far cry from the 235 PPI on the first pixel book and the impressive 293 PPI on the pixel sleep Google did build a go with a 4k screen but that option is only available if you get a top-of-the-line model which costs an eye-popping thirteen hundred and ninety nine dollars the good news is that the go as much slimmer bezels around the screen than the original pixel book but I still prefer the taller and more pixel dense display on that laptop to the screen on the go fortunately Google didn't skimp out on the keyboard the original pixel book offered a great typing experience and the go is almost as good I can't quite put my finger on what's different but the keys don't feel quite as soft when you're typing that set there's plenty of travel and they're pretty quiet Google about the whole thing right here the trackpad under their hand is just fine it feels kind of rough under my finger and scrolling around isn't as smooth as I'd like it's not bad and I've gotten used to it but I've definitely used better touch beds well google cut some corners in the design department the pixel book go is still among the more powerful Chromebooks out there the base model pairs an eighth generation Intel Core m3 processor with 8 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage the one I reviewed steps up to an i5 processor in 128 gigabytes of storage that model costs $849 comparable to what defined in the nine $99 pixel look I wish I could have tried that m3 model because I really want to see what kind of performance Google is offering for $650 unsurprisingly Intel's Core i5 and eight gigs of ram is plenty for Chrome OS the pixel book go handle my normal workload without any issues my routine involves a dozen or so browser tabs TweetDeck hangouts slack todoist google keep and Trello all running as Chrome apps along with the occasional Android app or to Adobe's Lightroom Netflix and YouTube music all mostly worked well although music playback had the occasional low memory hiccup which is frustrating notably this didn't happen when using YouTube music as a browser tab this reinforces my belief that Android apps on Chrome aren't usually worth using if there's a web-based alternative overall I can't imagine most people need to upgrade from the $849 model I tried Google was also selling in 999 configuration that doubles the range of 16 gigabytes well that $13.99 model I mentioned includes a core i7 processor 16 gigs of ram 206 gigs of storage and a 4k display well I'd surely enjoy that high res screen I don't think it's a worthwhile upgrade for anyone the pixel book though also holds up pretty well in the battery side something that wasn't always true with the original and our video playback test the go ran for just over 13 and a half hours before shutting down that's more than an hour longer than the 12 hour battery life google claims with mixed usage unfortunately I never came close to 12 hours and putting the go through my normal routine but it did last more than eight hours which is a definite improvement over the first pixel book all this said the pixel book go is a much easier device to evaluate than either the first pixel book or the pixel Slaten it's a standard familiar almost boring laptop but instead of figuring out if cromoz works on a convertible tablet or if you're willing to spend $1000 on a premium laptop the go is just a straightforward no-frills device it's still not particularly cheap especially if you step up to the i5 processor I tried but premium Chromebooks in the 600 to 800 dollar range are becoming more common now and now Google has something that can compete on quality as well as price yes you can still get a Chromebook for less money than what Google was asked for the NGO if you think a Chromebook can be your main computer and don't mind paying a little extra for a device that's thin light and well engineered the pixel book go will likely meet your
