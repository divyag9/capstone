Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!, [Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here this is the pixel for excel this is one of the phones I was looking forward to the most this entire year for 2019 for a couple of reasons and so now I've been using it daily since its unveiling this is my honest review so let's just start with the wait looks I honestly think it's a pretty decent looking phone it's low-key really clean there's almost no markings along the back just the Google G at the bottom matte black aluminum rails as part of the design all the way around the phone speaker slots at the bottom lined up with the USB type-c port and the colored power button of course on every version and the whole back of the phone on two of the colors is this soft touch matte finish which does a great job of not showing fingerprints it doesn't seem to scratch very easily at all so of the three colors available I'm gonna say this white this Panda version is the best one that power buttons pretty sweet then I'm gonna say oh so orange is in second place not so great power button but at least it's matte and then that jet-black weirdly very glossy version is in third place fun fact though since the rails are still matte black you can slap a matte black D brand skin on the back of any of these phones and you just created the matte black everything phone Google should have made in the first place so link to that below and of course shout out to D brand for sponsoring this video the pixels square camera bump is again annoyingly a little bit raised but I don't find this as drastic as say Apple's larger double raised triple camera bump but more on the cameras later so yeah you know what generally it's grown on me pretty decent looking phone I was though let a little bit down by the not super clicky buttons just the volume ones mainly but on the other hand something a lot of people have missed that's good to know the phone is now ip68 water-resistant it still has the squeeze sensitivity for the assistant and it still has stereo speakers so they're not front-facing pair like they were last year but they are still a good sounding solid pair with the slots at the bottom and the earpiece speaker combined the worst part about the way this phone looks is the front the part you look at most of the time I'm not a fan of the forehead it has a smaller chin at the bottom than before but yeah that big forehead I don't like it I'm still kind of barely getting used to it and overall the reason for the forehead doesn't really have me convinced so there's a cluster of new sensors up here in the top including the selfie camera then also infrared projector receiver and radar which is new in any smartphone and this new sensor suite up here is good for two things the fastest face unlock in any smartphone and some gestures okay maybe it makes me a little not forward-thinking but I still like fingerprint sensors and this phone has none of that the face unlock is the only biometric unlock this phone has and I find myself missing a fingerprint sensor and the rate of improvement for fingerprint sensors under the glass has been pretty good so that move was not my favorite pixel for uses a radar sensor to essentially project a little bubble around the phone to see when things are near it when things are in the bubble want to enter it exit it etc so when you reach for your phone basically your hand enters the bubble and it starts firing up the infrared and face unlock sensors early so by the time you pick the phone up it's already reading your face and logging you in and it's incredibly fast over and over again it's super impressive possibly too fast this kind of reminds me of the 1 plus 6 and other phones that would just do face unlock with just the RGB cameras so they'd be insanely fast they would just see anything that looks like you and just unlock as soon as you glanced at it so this isn't that it's still infrared so it still can't be fooled by a photo or video of you it still works in the dark and things like that so it's got advantages but it's still a little bit wild I find myself just unlocking this phone left and right all the time anytime I even just look at it sometimes I pick up the phone just to move it across my desk and I'll just glance at the time and it unlocks the phone it also doesn't require your attention so it will unlock with your eyes closed that's a that's a bit of a weird security quirk and it actually even tells you it'll do this in the settings when you turn this on it says looking at the phone can unlock it when you don't intend it to and your device can be unlocked by someone even if it's held up to your face even if your eyes are closed and potentially could be unlocked by someone who just looks a lot like you these are things that could pretend chillie be fixed or improved with a software update and Google's been pretty good about software updates but as of right now they're just pretty annoying my solution is turn off the skip lockscreen option so if I do accidentally unlock it at least it won't be awake for a while it just sits on the lockscreen and then it'll go back to sleep but yeah I mean that's what I think I mean when I say I would have liked a fingerprint reader option it's a little safer we're a little more used to it and it just sort of works when we need it doesn't when we don't so that's face unlock but then these sensors also enable a couple very specific gestures so anytime you're in a situation you can wave over your phone and use the gesture the status bar sort of lights up it starts glowing and that means it's ready so those situations are alarm clocks timers media controls and a Pikachu live wallpaper and there are no instructions like really built into Android there's none in the Android 10 setup for example nothing really tells you what's going on when you first get that glowing bar you just kind of have to know so when an alarm or a timers going off as your hand enters that radar bubble it quiets the alarm and then you can dismiss it by tapping or swiping away over the phone that for me was my favorite it worked really well I can sleep with my phone on this pixel stand next to the bed and when the alarm goes off I just reach for and it's already quieting down the other thing that was less consistent for me is music apps so if you're in Spotify or Google Play Music or any supported app where that glowing bar starts showing up you can swipe forward and swipe back through previous and next tracks and yeah that's it just forward and backwards when I first tried this at the event I was getting a success rate of like 10 percent I'm not even exaggerating like it was pretty abysmal now with some troubleshooting and practice and some tips from Twitter I'd say I'm up to like a 70 percent swipe success rate maybe 75 so it's less of like a big arm movement although that sometimes does work but it's more of like a casual swipe and not too close to the phone like right around where that radar bubble might be I think the real problem is it doesn't show you or tell you how to do it then made by Google Twitter account they tweeted at me saying you can go to the pixel tips app which is pre-installed on the pixel click save time and then click try it and then there you will find a demo if you want to practice it but even then there isn't actually I tried it there isn't actually any feedback it's just letting you practice so all of that being said I'm still not gonna use these it sort of falls in that same gimmick bucket as the g8 weird hover hand swiping action if it told me how to do it better maybe I'd be more into it but yeah not gonna use these if there's anything to love about the front of this phone it's the new display pixel 4 and pixel 4 XL have made the jump to smooth high res high refresh rate 90 Hertz displays my favorite trend in smartphones of the past year so it's difficult to show you exactly how much better that looks obviously I keep saying on camera because this is a 30fps video you know the correct frame rate but in person it makes a huge difference and every time a new phone comes out with a 90 Hertz or higher display I can see a serious difference versus 60 Hertz it comes with some trade-offs though it's not the brightest display sometimes daytime visibility is pretty weak unfortunately so I'm keeping this phone at max brightness often and high refresh rate also requires more power so you're gonna see a hit on battery life now initially I was we're all concerned about the battery life on pixel for knowing it has a higher fresh rate and then the XL having a 3700 milliamp hour battery and the smaller pixel for having a 2800 milliamp hour battery that's one the smallest I've seen in a phone in a while but impressively these phones have had for me ok battery life but there's a big reason for that I was briefly messaging Dave Toodee who's he's testing this smaller pixel for and he said he's getting around 5 hours of screen on time which if I take his word for it that's actually pretty impressive for me I've been getting around 5 hours on this XL on 90 Hertz which you know that's C+ which is a lot better than the F I thought it could be turns out the reason this phone has been able to get even okay battery life is because it ratchets down to 60 Hertz constantly all the time it's supposed to be smart about it so it says when you turn on smooth display that it'll turn back down to sixty Hertz when you're not looking at it or you're not using it much and then Ratchet it back up to 90 when you're swiping or you see animations and stuff but I found often it just stays at 60 Hertz for extended periods of time for no apparent reason it almost seemed like it was defaulting to 60 Hertz most of the time and then sometimes bumping up to 90 Hertz for scrolling and some other things I started to not like it I started to find that this phone felt significantly choppier like any other 60 Hertz phone then say the 1 + 7 Pro which seems like it's almost always at 90 Hertz so I was like okay this isn't great it's not my favorite implementation of 90 Hertz it smoothes sometimes but it's almost like a tease that it switches back and forth so much so I'm like digging around in developer options just to see if there's anything new and there is I found an option that I've never seen before it's called force 90 Hertz and it just keeps the display at 90 Hertz all the time no matter what's happening on the screen closer to what oneplus does and it's made a huge difference now it's always smooth so I guess pro tip if you're one of those people who's more of a power user and uses their phone all the time and wants to see that 90 Hertz happen you can go in the developer settings scroll down find force 90 Hertz and turn it on it will obliterate your battery life it's definitely even worse now closer to addy it's not lasting all day but at least it's smoother now anyway I also found that it has ambient EQ which is supposed to be auto adjusting the color temperature depending on the light around you kind of like apples true tone on the iPhone but I found it much more subtle so I just left it off it's not nearly as dramatic and overall it's just it's not the flashiest or most eye-catching or dramatic display on any smartphone it doesn't curve over the edges or anything but it's 90 Hertz it's 1440p it's OLED and it's flat but listen we all know what the pixel four is about so what the pixel 3 was about and it's what the pixel 2 was about it's the cameras and we got some new cameras on the back of the pixel 4 there's dual cameras back here it's a 12 megapixel primary camera and a new 16 megapixel 2x tell photocamera okay if you told me the pixel four would have the first second camera of any pixel phone and asked me what would be the most useless second camera they could put in the pixel right behind like a black and white depth sensor or a time-of-flight camera I would have put like a 2x telephoto lens just behind like an ultra-wide clearly being way more fun or a 3 or a 5x telephoto or any of that other stuff but that's what we got we got 2x telephoto but you know what specs are just one thing I got actually use it in person that's what I've been doing maybe it'll change my mind yeah it didn't really change my mind typical photos from the pixel four are very similar to pixel three great dynamic range great sharpness and detail very contrasting and punchy and dramatic and biasing a little bit towards cooler tones typically if anything but they're excellent photos they've got this image processing pipeline and their HDR down to a science and that didn't shock anyone thankfully so that's good and the improvements in the viewfinder are cool - you now have real-time approximation of the HDR effect you're going to get applied before you even snap the photo so there's no guessing you can pretty much just see what the final photo is gonna look like as you're taking it plus there's new sliders for exposure and shadow adjustment that can be really cool and you can mess with if you want but then having a second lens should mean portrait photos are better now because you have two lenses and you can finally do depth data between them I found that they're about the same matter of fact some of the ones I took of Mac here look worse than any I ever took on the pixel 3 just look at that cut out failure that's pretty terrible maybe I shouldn't depend on pet photos for my testing of portrait mode but I'm not exactly convinced by that but generally on photos of people it's doing about the same job with that aggressive cutout and I'm speaking of portrait mode you actually can't do wide portrait photos anymore which the pixel 3 took some of the best wide portrait photos but it gets even more double weird when you actually look into it so pixel 3 took some pretty great portraits with one wide camera right when you switch to portrait mode on the pixel 4 it automatically zooms in but not quite - 2 X - about point-seven or 1.8 X but then it doesn't let you zoom out and take wide portrait photos like the iPhone does but as I'm messing with this I realize if I cover the telephoto camera while I'm in portrait mode nothing happens it's still using the main camera for portrait mode photos is just using the second camera for depth approximation so why does it zoom in I have no answer for that so basically the best thing about having a telephoto camera is for zoomed in photos I don't take a lot of zoomed in photos but I did notice them higher quality so if you're someone who likes to go 6 8 X zoomed in you'll appreciate the better super resume there you go anyway the question still is is this the best camera in any smartphone because I think we can all agree pixel 3 was top of the stack last year but now the field is catching up especially iPhone 11 Pro so which is better ok honestly in daylight for most photos I prefer pixel photos I definitely like that contrast II punchy detailed look same with wide-angle selfies punchy detailed I'm a fan in lower light though I actually start to prefer iPhone photos and I know the pixel you know just got astrophotography capabilities that are really cool and nitesite has always been great for well over a year now but they get a little more dramatic and as a result a little more noisy and iPhones new night mode and deep fusion I think stayed Scheuer to life and as a result better in quality fun fact actually did a collab that's live now with super staff in one of his legendary side-by-side photo comparisons so that's the best way to see the differences between the two so you can see iPhone 11 Pro versus pixel 4 side-by-side and all their glory I'll leave a link below to that so is this the best camera in any smartphone sometimes I'm gonna say it's a toss-up depending on the scenario and that's not a cop-out I gave my reasons but if I could only pick one which is sort of a different question I would pick iPhone 11 Pro because it's more versatile it has the ultra wide and it absolutely crushes it in video like video is just not as much of a focus with the pickle forest camera anymore no pun intended it tops out at 4k 30fps which Google tweeted is because it would basically take up too much storage but then like you could still enabled it in if you really cared right and that also it doesn't explain why it doesn't have 24 FPS video which would have been a cool addition and it also tops out at 1080p from the front-facing wide camera so just generally if you're in it for video you shouldn't be looking at pixel you should be looking at iPhone 11 Pro my pixel vs. iPhone camera graph is like this pair of lines where the middle is where most photos are taken most of the time and that's where I prefer pixel but on the edges of photography like low-light or ultra wide then the iPhone does better so there hopefully that explanation makes sense and then you can't forget Android 10 which gets the special treatment on the pixel since it's Google's baby there are some good features here that add to how smart it is as a smart phone you already heard about the radar bubble and the smart unlock features they move the text-to-speech offline local on the phone so text-to-speech is way faster and way more consistent I love that you can talk as fast as you want and it just works and there's a new voice recorder app that takes advantage of that to live transcribe everything you say and then index is that text to make it searchable that's like an S Pen level feature I personally probably won't use it too much but I can see how people who use that would find it a really big deal but yeah the best part of a pixel again is how refined Android is if you want the latest version of Android if you want to be first with updates if you want the coolest edge features and the assistant and all that is the phone again so overall many of the conclusions about pixel 4 are of course about how disappointing it is which i think is an easy conclusion to reach if you've followed all the leaks and nothing really surprised you and are things that are let down I personally really enjoyed using pixel because of the punchy confident excellent camera for still photos and the 90 Hertz display which a lot of phones don't have yet and of course the extra RAM finally a smooth pixel phone but this isn't a phone I'm gonna go around recommending to everyone it still needs a bigger battery still needs more storage and it's just generally not complete for most people so I guess if you're like me which is in a tiny group of people who really like high refresh rate screens of course value the camera and want the latest version of Android and these clicked up to and things like that and you're willing to overpay because we all know the pixel is a bit overpriced for the storage you don't get then sure I recommend the pixel it's great for people like that but for most people I'm not gonna end up recommending the pixel for mainly because of the battery but also because there are just better deals out there right now including the cheaper iPhone 11 weird to say but it kind of hits the ear funny but it's true so there you have it the pixel for possibly a victim of the hype machine of being the most leaked phone of all time I kind of wouldn't be surprised if it happens again next year but either way now you know what it's like to own it and I'm curious are you in this tiny group of people who would like this pixel experience let me know either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfbSqTB74xM
Unboxing Every Google Pixel 4," it's Google pixel for day and of course as you should know we've got every single version sitting in front of me this every single version right well okay so it's the for excel in the three different colors they always got fancy names for the colors a clearly white oh so orange just black and so we have the Excel versions on the top and then below that you wouldn't know from the size of the box but we have the standard size pixel for some specifications for each here the XL 6.3 inch display 128 gigs of storage on this particular model the non XL version pixel for 5.7 inch display this is fresh it's hot off the presses so this video it's just it's an unboxing video and a first-look type of video just keep that in mind f HD Plus flexible OLED 444 PPI and then qhd+ so a higher pixel density on the XL at 5:37 DPI Gorilla Glass 5 on both oh they're gonna have 90 Hertz smooth displays you know that kind of quickie buttery what about a milkshake yeah is that smooth not bad the little guy is 2,800 milliamp hours at the big one 3700 both 18 watt fast charging and wireless charging and then of course a big thing near the cameras the brand new design on the back now they're like no we're gonna give you the versatility of multiple camera lenses white pixel for excel and the first thing you're gonna notice here a similar effect to the Panda version white on the back but then you get the black cutout for the cameras you get the black Ridge on the frame this is all metal and then the entire front of the device is black so it's a panda effect black and white I think a lot of people I think some people gonna like that mmm-hmm a USB type-c cable as well as a USB adapter and then this is the aforementioned power brick with the quick charge capability that's also orange this is for the for those that want to make more of a statement that's obviously a look I should also mention at this point it's a glass back it's a matte finish it's not a glossy finish oh yeah you're right it is glossy so on the black version the power switch is going to be this white color and on the other two versions actually and then on the orange phone it gets a little bit lighter in color that's yeah interesting choices here this is a very simple look to it but of course with any glossy finish you're opening yourself up to finger prints and so forth so you guys decide it looks fancy though this form factor is gonna be familiar to you it's a very practical utility more than anything easier to hold yes will he do ladies and gentlemen this is the small one I'll just place that there's your comparison right there big and small I'm gravitating towards this color there we go put that guy right on top I look down okay [Music] I notice straightaway here that the emphasis unlike a lot of other smartphone makers is not on screen to body ratio they're they're cool with having a forehead a chin on the device not overwhelmingly slim bezels a lot of that has to do with packing extra tech into the top forehead section of the device to NIR cameras dot projector flood emitter a camera as well with a 90 degree field of view fixed focus the pixel 4 &amp; 4 XL are now exclusively face on lock no fingerprint on the back no fingerprint in the display face unlock is enough and I guess they believe that's the future going forward with this degree of technology being baked in and giving up so much in the screen to body ratio department they've got to be cool with it and think that's the way to go so let's go ahead and give it a give it a test I'm going to scan my face in here he's locked phone unlocked phone locked phone unlocked phone I mean you just have to commit more space to have the extra tech built-in but you get you get stuff like the ability to illuminate the face in darker environments which if face unlock is going to be the only unlock available exclusively you kind of need that we can load up the front-facing camera real quick now you get the extra camera on the back and the singular camera on the front so it's a it's a switch obviously you have portrait you have night sight built-in all right this is a fresh device it's possibly not even final software number two all right so within the options of course you can configure the amount of processing that takes place this is with some of the natural face stuff turned off we have an abundance of boxes here so let's give that a quick shot as you can see here you get the wider look or you can move in a little bit closer let's try a 4x zoom I mean it's interesting because in the preview you can actually see some of the noise and stuff that you would traditionally have with a digitally zoomed image but then in the finished product the software runs such a process on it it eliminates all of that you can see a couple of cutouts on the bottom presumably for your speaker and microphone as well as your type-c connector interestingly in the spec sheet it lists a nano-sim or an e sim configurability alright so since we have the two displays stacked up I think that's gonna be an interesting characteristic for a lot of people mostly because they've added 90 Hertz to it now so what that means for people that are unfamiliar is you get this really twitchy kind of input really responsive field in fact it makes the entire phone feel faster alright maybe we should play a video let's just compare the speakers on the two units here I've got one of these surface laptop threes coming in well you didn't know that Jack caught you off-guard you know that a significant amount of sound is coming out of two different ports substantial sound from each area it's more volume than you might be used to out of the both of them balanced let's compare it to the little phone it all sounds very good on paper of course the marketplace will wait but talking a lot recently about trying to nail down the perfect laptop it's a real mission of mine so the larger than usual forehead there's also sensors in there capable of motion tracking tracking of a hand gestures Google's calling it motion sense because this software is early I can't showcase it to you at the moment but it's another trade-off I mean you're packing in some extra hardware for the potential to interact with your device without touching it beyond just assistant in your voice now potentially I'm scrolling and swiping without even touching it on the final version of the software it's also important to know I mean with the pixel devices in general it means you're getting the latest software that means you're getting features first including the latest when it comes to assistant ok Google what is unbox therapy and you can see the way that its installed the way that it's implemented is different than it used to be a lot happens now right within the main screen so you don't jump over to a different app in order to engage it and of course the advanced version of that is the continuation of conversation which is the initial instruction and then the deeper dive with assistant understanding context so you want to say okay Google hey Siri merely is often I think the biggest takeaway here is going to be Google moving towards 90 Hertz display for one and then secondary it's going to be camera performance eventually on final software what it's capable of from a computational perspective that's every single one on box as I mentioned this is just a first-look type of video I'll have a follow-up today's pixel day it just came out so you have two clearly white excel oh I should also mention that oh so orange is apparently limited edition so if you're interested I don't know what you guys do line up get your order in go black version which is the only glossy one of the bunch if that's what you're into polished fancy type of lifestyle you can go for that look as well I think I'm leaning towards this one right",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OhZjfwi1Rs
Google Pixelbook Go review: Function over form, Google has been building its own Chromebooks for a while now first there were two iterations of the Chromebook pixel and then there was 2017 pixel book all three worked great laptops with one huge flaw they cost way too much money Google's back at it again this year with the new pixel book go and for the first time Google's not trying to make the best Chromebook ever price be damned [Music] instead Google is trying to build a Chromebook that anyone can use and afford the pixel will go starts at six hundred and fifty dollars a full 350 less than the original pixel book it's still a lot of money for a Chromebook but for the first time Google's built something better than the cheap low-end Chromebooks out there that still semi affordable unfortunately in its quest to get the price down Google also second rest a lot of what made the original pixel looks so intriguing in the first place but for a lot of people those trade-offs will be worth it all of Google's previous Chromebooks as well as last year's ill-fated pixel slate tablet had distinctive designs and premium hardware with very few corners cut while the pixel book though is a nice device it's a phone or pedestrian computer than anything Google has released thus far it's a basic looking clamshell laptop with a 13.3 inch 1080p touchscreen and a black paint job unmarked except for a small Google Gee logo in the corner of the lid it also comes in very light pink with a bright coral underside a much more distinctive combo but the all-black has a certain understated elegance either way the go feels sturdy and well built but doesn't have any of the distinctive design elements you'll see in the original pixel book it's thicker than that device still weighs about the same at 2.3 pounds I definitely miss the aesthetics of the original though particularly it's glass an aluminum lid that echoed the design of goulds pixel phones the go as a functional utilitarian design which I can appreciate but I wish it was slightly more exciting there is one new funky design flourish to be found the pixel book go it's ridged underside for whatever reason pictures made me think that this was a different softer material than the magnesium that makes up the rest of the goes case but it doesn't feel any different than the rest of the device google says it design needs word just to make the laptop easier to grip or pull out of a sleeve but I can't have had any problems handling other computers still it's good to see Google's more playful side on this otherwise dull laptop and while the goal might be a little boring it still feels nicer and sturdier than almost any other Chromebook on the market the otherwise excellent Asus Chromebook flip that I reviewed earlier this year it's much heavier than the go for example Google's surely simplified its design as a way to cut costs and as such there are some other notable changes to the go compared to its predecessor unlike the first pixel book it's not a convertible so tablet mode is out that also means it doesn't work with the pixel book pen stylus both the pixel book in the pixel slate at excellent displays with a taller aspect ratio and higher resolutions in the pixel book go and I'm a little sad to see the step back and display quality here that's not to say the Dell has a bad screen it's just not nearly as gorgeous to look at as those last two computers 1080p on a 13.3 inch screen works out to 166 pixels per inch a far cry from the 235 PPI on the first pixel book and the impressive 293 PPI on the pixel sleep Google did build a go with a 4k screen but that option is only available if you get a top-of-the-line model which costs an eye-popping thirteen hundred and ninety nine dollars the good news is that the go as much slimmer bezels around the screen than the original pixel book but I still prefer the taller and more pixel dense display on that laptop to the screen on the go fortunately Google didn't skimp out on the keyboard the original pixel book offered a great typing experience and the go is almost as good I can't quite put my finger on what's different but the keys don't feel quite as soft when you're typing that set there's plenty of travel and they're pretty quiet Google about the whole thing right here the trackpad under their hand is just fine it feels kind of rough under my finger and scrolling around isn't as smooth as I'd like it's not bad and I've gotten used to it but I've definitely used better touch beds well google cut some corners in the design department the pixel book go is still among the more powerful Chromebooks out there the base model pairs an eighth generation Intel Core m3 processor with 8 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage the one I reviewed steps up to an i5 processor in 128 gigabytes of storage that model costs $849 comparable to what defined in the nine $99 pixel look I wish I could have tried that m3 model because I really want to see what kind of performance Google is offering for $650 unsurprisingly Intel's Core i5 and eight gigs of ram is plenty for Chrome OS the pixel book go handle my normal workload without any issues my routine involves a dozen or so browser tabs TweetDeck hangouts slack todoist google keep and Trello all running as Chrome apps along with the occasional Android app or to Adobe's Lightroom Netflix and YouTube music all mostly worked well although music playback had the occasional low memory hiccup which is frustrating notably this didn't happen when using YouTube music as a browser tab this reinforces my belief that Android apps on Chrome aren't usually worth using if there's a web-based alternative overall I can't imagine most people need to upgrade from the $849 model I tried Google was also selling in 999 configuration that doubles the range of 16 gigabytes well that $13.99 model I mentioned includes a core i7 processor 16 gigs of ram 206 gigs of storage and a 4k display well I'd surely enjoy that high res screen I don't think it's a worthwhile upgrade for anyone the pixel book though also holds up pretty well in the battery side something that wasn't always true with the original and our video playback test the go ran for just over 13 and a half hours before shutting down that's more than an hour longer than the 12 hour battery life google claims with mixed usage unfortunately I never came close to 12 hours and putting the go through my normal routine but it did last more than eight hours which is a definite improvement over the first pixel book all this said the pixel book go is a much easier device to evaluate than either the first pixel book or the pixel Slaten it's a standard familiar almost boring laptop but instead of figuring out if cromoz works on a convertible tablet or if you're willing to spend $1000 on a premium laptop the go is just a straightforward no-frills device it's still not particularly cheap especially if you step up to the i5 processor I tried but premium Chromebooks in the 600 to 800 dollar range are becoming more common now and now Google has something that can compete on quality as well as price yes you can still get a Chromebook for less money than what Google was asked for the NGO if you think a Chromebook can be your main computer and don't mind paying a little extra for a device that's thin light and well engineered the pixel book go will likely meet your needs thanks for watching and subscribe to and gadgets YouTube channel for more news and

GoPro Max review: the most accessible 360 camera," (mellow piano music) (upbeat music) - This is the GoPro MAX. And it's GoPro's second attempt at a consumer level, 360 camera. (camera whirring) Last year, Insta360 came out with the One X, and it totally revolutionized the idea of what a 360 camera could be used for. First off, footage shot with the One X was stitched in camera, and then you were able to edit it right on your phone and upload to social platforms almost instantly. Secondly, they market it not as a 360-degree camera but instead a camera that could shoot 360 degrees of possible angles. Now fast forward a year and we have the GoPro Max, which is the successor to the GoPro Fusion that came out in 2017, that was filled with all of the headaches of 360's past. It required two memory cards. You had to stitch the footage on a desktop. But they overhauled all of that with the Max, and they in turn made a really accessible 360 camera, which makes me believe I might continue to actually use this thing. ♪ We wag, we wag, we wag, we wag, we wag ♪ ♪ This is the widest angle GoPro's made ♪ ♪ This is the wide ♪ The GoPro MAX has dual 180-degree lenses that shoot 16.6-megapixel, 360-degree photos, 5.5-megapixel single lens, or GoPro is calling Max SuperView photos, and the super cool 6.2-megapixel panoramic photos called PowerPanos. Video-wise, you have 1440p60 video with a single lens and 5.6K30 spherical video, just like the Insta360. There are mics on all but one side and it shows the same super satisfying rubber buttons and button layout as the Hero8. On the bottom, you have these new stowable mounting prongs, which alas, you no longer need that housing, which I somehow always manage to forget anyways, and it also makes it compatible with all GoPro mounts. The touchscreen on the Max is a bit smaller than the touchscreen on the back of the Hero, but its menu system is identical. The big plus here is if you're vlogging or taking a selfie, you can see yourself much like on the DJI Osmo Action because, well, there's lenses on both sides. The Max is waterproof up to 16 feet. But that proofing is merely for protection at this point. GoPro claims that it's really difficult to stitch underwater footage, but they are promising some sort of waterproof housing in the future. The screen is super responsive, but you can't scroll around your frame in 360 mode since the screen has swiping gestures such as swiping down to reach the main menu. You can however switch between lenses but only while not recording. Once you hit that record button, the screen has no functionality other than just being a viewfinder to the lens that you chose before rolling. The image on the screen will however stay level with the horizon no matter which way you turn the camera. And it does so with almost no noticeable lag. If you lean into that warped, super fisheye look that only a 360 camera could give you, the footage is sick. Skin tones are true to life and it's not afraid to overexpose the highlights of it. I prefer this to the flatter color grade of the One X, especially for users who won't be color correcting. And how even if you are color correcting, I find that the Max and the One X have very little latitude in the coloring process. Now, if you're only gonna be showing these photos on social platforms that you're gonna look at on a phone, who cares, but for a camera that costs $500, I hope it's going a little further than that. (laughs). The Max's 360° video is stabilized in software. It bobs up and down as you'd expect from walking and it can be really jittery, especially at night. The stitching is most noticeable at the top and the bottom of the frame. And since most of GoPro's mounts typically have a wider base than the camera itself, there's almost always a bit of artifact from the mount in the footage. Over-all though, once you export the 360-degree footage, the stitch is pretty clean. The audio, however, is probably the best I've seen on a camera this size. The wind reduction can add a lot of compression, and enough wind can sound like, well this, (wind blowing) Guys, when I say it's windy out, it's like actually very windy out. I am about to blow over. This might make some really good footage as I fly away. But when you're not in 25-mile an hour wind, it actually reduces the sound of wind while prioritizing voices. So while hiking with Alex, I love that the GoPro picked up on the crickets and footsteps, while also keeping our voices at the forefront no matter where the camera was in space. ♪ Yeah, and I think it's gonna be a long, long time ♪ And then there are those PowerPano photos. I gotta be honest guys, I had a tough time not showing you these photos before this video dropped. I mean first and foremost, they make taking a panoramic photo a lot easier. And you don't have to stand there and slowly and robotically move your phone across the landscape. I was really surprised at how crisp these photos turned out to. Even on a desktop, they still look really cool. The time warp feature in 360 mode, which is when the Max just records the time lapse, is really cool, but it's a total battery killer. I saw my battery drop 15% off a fresh charge while shooting this time warp. And I let it record for all of 10 minutes. I think it would help if the screen would go off a bit sooner while shooting these to save some battery. Otherwise, the battery performance is on par with the Hero8. Even though it is a different battery. So yes, you will need to buy extra spares if you plan on heavy use. I was able to get through a full day of heavy use using two of these batteries. 360 cameras are only accessible though if you can do something with the footage. So the software has to be sound, and GoPro's app makes it really easy to edit this footage. Max uses the same GoPro app as the Heroes. Now, I'm no stranger to keyframes, but I think even a casual non-video director from the verge.com could edit the Max's 360 footage. And I actually enjoyed editing it on the app. GoPro also has a 360 desktop app called GoPro Player, which mirrors the mobile app experience with added codec options at export. You have H.264, ProRes, HUVC, and as far as 360 editing goes, I was blown away by its ease. Okay so there's this whole other mode on the Max called Hero mode. And it's basically just when the camera's using one lens as opposed to two. It has more mic controls and it even boasts GoPro's most stable video called Max HyperSmooth. And it also has the widest field of view called Max SuperView. But I gotta be honest, while it does sound good and the footage is stable, the fact that it maxes out at 1440p60 is noticeable. Especially in how much smoothing is being done when the subject is close to the camera. I also noticed the camera struggled to keep the footage level with the horizon, choosing to instead focus on keeping the footage stable. So when climbing down this trail, which to be fair, is a slanted surface, the horizon kept tilting further and further from level to almost a dizzying point. GoPro has become a household name. I mean they're specced out, durable, tiny, portable beasts of cameras. And the Max is no different. And while the Max has great features such as PowerPano, it also has great hardware and a really good touch screen. But for me, it came down to the ease of use of the app that made me wanna keep using this thing. 360 footage used to mean high-end equipment and tons of headaches and post, and that always pushed me away from using it. But when you put all of that into the form factor of a GoPro, a workflow I've been using for years, it's way more approachable. Now, is all of that enough to make this thing more than a novelty camera that will ultimately end up in my forgotten type bed in my basement? Time will truly tell. But it is the most fun and user-friendly 360 camera I have used today. And I'm excited to see this thing as specced out. (coughing) 4K Hero mode? Please? All right, so for 499, you can pre-order a Max today. They start shipping on October 24th and will be on shelves October 27th. The 360 space is getting kinda nuts and the One X versus the Max deserves its whole own videos, so I guess I'll see you guys next time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbUcgMT8VKQ
