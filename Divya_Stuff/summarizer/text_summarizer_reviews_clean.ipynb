    "text = \"(mellow piano music) (upbeat music) - This is the GoPro MAX. And it's GoPro's second attempt at a consumer level, 360 camera. (camera whirring) Last year, Insta360 came out with the One X, and it totally revolutionized the idea of what a 360 camera could be used for. First off, footage shot with the One X was stitched in camera, and then you were able to edit it right on your phone and upload to social platforms almost instantly. Secondly, they market it not as a 360-degree camera but instead a camera that could shoot 360 degrees of possible angles. Now fast forward a year and we have the GoPro Max, which is the successor to the GoPro Fusion that came out in 2017, that was filled with all of the headaches of 360's past. It required two memory cards. You had to stitch the footage on a desktop. But they overhauled all of that with the Max, and they in turn made a really accessible 360 camera, which makes me believe I might continue to actually use this thing. ♪ We wag, we wag, we wag, we wag, we wag ♪ ♪ This is the widest angle GoPro's made ♪ ♪ This is the wide ♪ The GoPro MAX has dual 180-degree lenses that shoot 16.6-megapixel, 360-degree photos, 5.5-megapixel single lens, or GoPro is calling Max SuperView photos, and the super cool 6.2-megapixel panoramic photos called PowerPanos. Video-wise, you have 1440p60 video with a single lens and 5.6K30 spherical video, just like the Insta360. There are mics on all but one side and it shows the same super satisfying rubber buttons and button layout as the Hero8. On the bottom, you have these new stowable mounting prongs, which alas, you no longer need that housing, which I somehow always manage to forget anyways, and it also makes it compatible with all GoPro mounts. The touchscreen on the Max is a bit smaller than the touchscreen on the back of the Hero, but its menu system is identical. The big plus here is if you're vlogging or taking a selfie, you can see yourself much like on the DJI Osmo Action because, well, there's lenses on both sides. The Max is waterproof up to 16 feet. But that proofing is merely for protection at this point. GoPro claims that it's really difficult to stitch underwater footage, but they are promising some sort of waterproof housing in the future. The screen is super responsive, but you can't scroll around your frame in 360 mode since the screen has swiping gestures such as swiping down to reach the main menu. You can however switch between lenses but only while not recording. Once you hit that record button, the screen has no functionality other than just being a viewfinder to the lens that you chose before rolling. The image on the screen will however stay level with the horizon no matter which way you turn the camera. And it does so with almost no noticeable lag. If you lean into that warped, super fisheye look that only a 360 camera could give you, the footage is sick. Skin tones are true to life and it's not afraid to overexpose the highlights of it. I prefer this to the flatter color grade of the One X, especially for users who won't be color correcting. And how even if you are color correcting, I find that the Max and the One X have very little latitude in the coloring process. Now, if you're only gonna be showing these photos on social platforms that you're gonna look at on a phone, who cares, but for a camera that costs $500, I hope it's going a little further than that. (laughs). The Max's 360° video is stabilized in software. It bobs up and down as you'd expect from walking and it can be really jittery, especially at night. The stitching is most noticeable at the top and the bottom of the frame. And since most of GoPro's mounts typically have a wider base than the camera itself, there's almost always a bit of artifact from the mount in the footage. Over-all though, once you export the 360-degree footage, the stitch is pretty clean. The audio, however, is probably the best I've seen on a camera this size. The wind reduction can add a lot of compression, and enough wind can sound like, well this, (wind blowing) Guys, when I say it's windy out, it's like actually very windy out. I am about to blow over. This might make some really good footage as I fly away. But when you're not in 25-mile an hour wind, it actually reduces the sound of wind while prioritizing voices. So while hiking with Alex, I love that the GoPro picked up on the crickets and footsteps, while also keeping our voices at the forefront no matter where the camera was in space. ♪ Yeah, and I think it's gonna be a long, long time ♪ And then there are those PowerPano photos. I gotta be honest guys, I had a tough time not showing you these photos before this video dropped. I mean first and foremost, they make taking a panoramic photo a lot easier. And you don't have to stand there and slowly and robotically move your phone across the landscape. I was really surprised at how crisp these photos turned out to. Even on a desktop, they still look really cool. The time warp feature in 360 mode, which is when the Max just records the time lapse, is really cool, but it's a total battery killer. I saw my battery drop 15% off a fresh charge while shooting this time warp. And I let it record for all of 10 minutes. I think it would help if the screen would go off a bit sooner while shooting these to save some battery. Otherwise, the battery performance is on par with the Hero8. Even though it is a different battery. So yes, you will need to buy extra spares if you plan on heavy use. I was able to get through a full day of heavy use using two of these batteries. 360 cameras are only accessible though if you can do something with the footage. So the software has to be sound, and GoPro's app makes it really easy to edit this footage. Max uses the same GoPro app as the Heroes. Now, I'm no stranger to keyframes, but I think even a casual non-video director from the verge.com could edit the Max's 360 footage. And I actually enjoyed editing it on the app. GoPro also has a 360 desktop app called GoPro Player, which mirrors the mobile app experience with added codec options at export. You have H.264, ProRes, HUVC, and as far as 360 editing goes, I was blown away by its ease. Okay so there's this whole other mode on the Max called Hero mode. And it's basically just when the camera's using one lens as opposed to two. It has more mic controls and it even boasts GoPro's most stable video called Max HyperSmooth. And it also has the widest field of view called Max SuperView. But I gotta be honest, while it does sound good and the footage is stable, the fact that it maxes out at 1440p60 is noticeable. Especially in how much smoothing is being done when the subject is close to the camera. I also noticed the camera struggled to keep the footage level with the horizon, choosing to instead focus on keeping the footage stable. So when climbing down this trail, which to be fair, is a slanted surface, the horizon kept tilting further and further from level to almost a dizzying point. GoPro has become a household name. I mean they're specced out, durable, tiny, portable beasts of cameras. And the Max is no different. And while the Max has great features such as PowerPano, it also has great hardware and a really good touch screen. But for me, it came down to the ease of use of the app that made me wanna keep using this thing. 360 footage used to mean high-end equipment and tons of headaches and post, and that always pushed me away from using it. But when you put all of that into the form factor of a GoPro, a workflow I've been using for years, it's way more approachable. Now, is all of that enough to make this thing more than a novelty camera that will ultimately end up in my forgotten type bed in my basement? Time will truly tell. But it is the most fun and user-friendly 360 camera I have used today. And I'm excited to see this thing as specced out. (coughing) 4K Hero mode? Please? All right, so for 499, you can pre-order a Max today. They start shipping on October 24th and will be on shelves October 27th. The 360 space is getting kinda nuts\""

    "text = \" Google has been building its own Chromebooks for a while now first there were two iterations of the Chromebook pixel and then there was 2017 pixel book all three worked great laptops with one huge flaw they cost way too much money Google's back at it again this year with the new pixel book go and for the first time Google's not trying to make the best Chromebook ever price be damned [Music] instead Google is trying to build a Chromebook that anyone can use and afford the pixel will go starts at six hundred and fifty dollars a full 350 less than the original pixel book it's still a lot of money for a Chromebook but for the first time Google's built something better than the cheap low-end Chromebooks out there that still semi affordable unfortunately in its quest to get the price down Google also second rest a lot of what made the original pixel looks so intriguing in the first place but for a lot of people those trade-offs will be worth it all of Google's previous Chromebooks as well as last year's ill-fated pixel slate tablet had distinctive designs and premium hardware with very few corners cut while the pixel book though is a nice device it's a phone or pedestrian computer than anything Google has released thus far it's a basic looking clamshell laptop with a 13.3 inch 1080p touchscreen and a black paint job unmarked except for a small Google Gee logo in the corner of the lid it also comes in very light pink with a bright coral underside a much more distinctive combo but the all-black has a certain understated elegance either way the go feels sturdy and well built but doesn't have any of the distinctive design elements you'll see in the original pixel book it's thicker than that device still weighs about the same at 2.3 pounds I definitely miss the aesthetics of the original though particularly it's glass an aluminum lid that echoed the design of goulds pixel phones the go as a functional utilitarian design which I can appreciate but I wish it was slightly more exciting there is one new funky design flourish to be found the pixel book go it's ridged underside for whatever reason pictures made me think that this was a different softer material than the magnesium that makes up the rest of the goes case but it doesn't feel any different than the rest of the device google says it design needs word just to make the laptop easier to grip or pull out of a sleeve but I can't have had any problems handling other computers still it's good to see Google's more playful side on this otherwise dull laptop and while the goal might be a little boring it still feels nicer and sturdier than almost any other Chromebook on the market the otherwise excellent Asus Chromebook flip that I reviewed earlier this year it's much heavier than the go for example Google's surely simplified its design as a way to cut costs and as such there are some other notable changes to the go compared to its predecessor unlike the first pixel book it's not a convertible so tablet mode is out that also means it doesn't work with the pixel book pen stylus both the pixel book in the pixel slate at excellent displays with a taller aspect ratio and higher resolutions in the pixel book go and I'm a little sad to see the step back and display quality here that's not to say the Dell has a bad screen it's just not nearly as gorgeous to look at as those last two computers 1080p on a 13.3 inch screen works out to 166 pixels per inch a far cry from the 235 PPI on the first pixel book and the impressive 293 PPI on the pixel sleep Google did build a go with a 4k screen but that option is only available if you get a top-of-the-line model which costs an eye-popping thirteen hundred and ninety nine dollars the good news is that the go as much slimmer bezels around the screen than the original pixel book but I still prefer the taller and more pixel dense display on that laptop to the screen on the go fortunately Google didn't skimp out on the keyboard the original pixel book offered a great typing experience and the go is almost as good I can't quite put my finger on what's different but the keys don't feel quite as soft when you're typing that set there's plenty of travel and they're pretty quiet Google about the whole thing right here the trackpad under their hand is just fine it feels kind of rough under my finger and scrolling around isn't as smooth as I'd like it's not bad and I've gotten used to it but I've definitely used better touch beds well google cut some corners in the design department the pixel book go is still among the more powerful Chromebooks out there the base model pairs an eighth generation Intel Core m3 processor with 8 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage the one I reviewed steps up to an i5 processor in 128 gigabytes of storage that model costs $849 comparable to what defined in the nine $99 pixel look I wish I could have tried that m3 model because I really want to see what kind of performance Google is offering for $650 unsurprisingly Intel's Core i5 and eight gigs of ram is plenty for Chrome OS the pixel book go handle my normal workload without any issues my routine involves a dozen or so browser tabs TweetDeck hangouts slack todoist google keep and Trello all running as Chrome apps along with the occasional Android app or to Adobe's Lightroom Netflix and YouTube music all mostly worked well although music playback had the occasional low memory hiccup which is frustrating notably this didn't happen when using YouTube music as a browser tab this reinforces my belief that Android apps on Chrome aren't usually worth using if there's a web-based alternative overall I can't imagine most people need to upgrade from the $849 model I tried Google was also selling in 999 configuration that doubles the range of 16 gigabytes well that $13.99 model I mentioned includes a core i7 processor 16 gigs of ram 206 gigs of storage and a 4k display well I'd surely enjoy that high res screen I don't think it's a worthwhile upgrade for anyone the pixel book though also holds up pretty well in the battery side something that wasn't always true with the original and our video playback test the go ran for just over 13 and a half hours before shutting down that's more than an hour longer than the 12 hour battery life google claims with mixed usage unfortunately I never came close to 12 hours and putting the go through my normal routine but it did last more than eight hours which is a definite improvement over the first pixel book all this said the pixel book go is a much easier device to evaluate than either the first pixel book or the pixel Slaten it's a standard familiar almost boring laptop but instead of figuring out if cromoz works on a convertible tablet or if you're willing to spend $1000 on a premium laptop the go is just a straightforward no-frills device it's still not particularly cheap especially if you step up to the i5 processor I tried but premium Chromebooks in the 600 to 800 dollar range are becoming more common now and now Google has something that can compete on quality as well as price yes you can still get a Chromebook for less money than what Google was asked for the NGO if you think a Chromebook can be your main computer and don't mind paying a little extra for a device that's thin light and well engineered the pixel book go will likely meet your needs thanks for watching and subscribe to and gadgets YouTube channel for more news and reviews\""

    "text = \"- Alright, it's iPhone time. Apple released three new iPhones all at once this year. The iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Now, I honestly think the iPhone 11 is the phone most people in the iOS ecosystem should get if they're upgrading. So we've got a whole other review of that phone that you should check out, too. But this, this is the Pro review. The dark mode, cash money review for professionals who use their phones to do pro stuff. Like taking telephoto photos. Actually, I have no idea why Apple called these phones Pro. They're basically just nice updates to the iPhone XS, but I also think it's a waste of time to argue about names. iPhone 11 Pro Max is a bad name. But you know what, it's a great phone. And I think Apple might have done it. This is the best camera I've ever seen on a phone. Let's get into it. (calming music) The iPhone 11 Pro looks almost exactly like the iPhone XS from the front. It's a little heavier and thicker, but unless you're comparing them directly, you probably won't notice. I certainly didn't. You do get a much bigger battery in exchange for that extra size, which Apple says leads to a four-hour battery life increase on the regular Pro and a five-hour jump for the Pro Max. But it's surprisingly hard to check that number. I'll get into why in a minute. The big difference from the XS comes on the back where Apple says the rear glass is now stronger and it comes in this frosted matte finish. It also integrates a glossy camera bump with three cameras. The whole back and the bump is a single piece of glass that's milled out. The iPhone 11 is the reverse. It has a glossy back and the camera bump is matte. Now you know. I got a lot of questions about this matte finish and I think it's really nice, especially in this new midnight green color. It didn't really pick up any fingerprints, but it does seem a tiny bit more slippery than the gloss back of the previous phones and the iPhone 11. But I also think most people are just going to stick this thing in a case, so it doesn't seem like a huge issue. A lot of people also asked me if this matte finish will scratch easily, similar to the back of the Pixel 3, and so far the answer seems to be no. But we're going to have to keep an eye on it over time. Apple's finally relented and included an 18W USB-C fast charger with the Pro phones. So you get a USB-C to Lightning cable as well. Now Apple's USB-C charger is not the smallest or prettiest charger out there. But anything is better than the slow 5W brick it's been including for years, so I'll take it. So let's get into these cameras. Apple has a lot at stake here. Google and Samsung's cameras have been outperforming the iPhone for a couple of years now. And Chinese phone makers, in particular, have been racing each other to add an endless array of photography features. If you're in the US, you're probably locked into iMessage and no camera is good enough to make you switch. But Apple doesn't have that advantage in big markets like Europe and China. Everyone uses WhatsApp and WeChat, and switching from iOS to Android is much easier. So Apple's added a bunch of features that first appeared on Android phones. There are three cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro. The telephoto camera has the same basic sensor, but a faster f/2.O lens. The main camera has the same f/1.8 lens and a slightly better sensor. And there's the new super fun ultra-wide camera, which is basically twice as wide as the main lens and f/2.4. And the f/2.2 front camera is now 12 megapixels, up from seven, and has a wider 24mm focal length so it can pull out to a slightly wider angle in landscape for selfies. Apple's also updated its smart HDR processing system, which I was not very impressed with when I reviewed the iPhone XS and XR. The iPhone 11 cameras are an enormous improvement over the XS, and beat the Pixel and Galaxy Note 10 in most of our tests. This shot of Verge video producer, Mariya Abdulkaf, outside in bright sunlight shouldn't be too hard for any camera to do a good job with. And all these photos look basically fine. But zoom and do 100 percent crop and the improvement from the iPhone XS to the iPhone 11 main camera is stunning. The iPhone 11 is way sharper, with way more detail. I also think the iPhone 11 does a way better job than the Note 10 and it's a little better to my eye than the Pixel 3. This improvement is due to something Apple's calling semantic rendering. Basically, Smart HDR recognizes what's in the image and renders it appropriately. I asked Apple to break down how it works for me and it basically goes like this: First, the iPhone starts taking photos to a buffer the instant you open the camera app. So by the time you actually press the button, it's captured four underexposed frames and the photo you want. Then it grabs one overexposed frame. This is all basically the same as the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3, except the Pixel doesn't grab that overexposed frame. Second, Smart HDR and semantic rendering then start looking for things in the photos it understands. Faces, hair, the sky, things like that. Then it uses additional detail from the under and overexposed frames to selectively process the areas of the image it's recognized. Hair gets sharpened, but the sky doesn't. It just gets de-noised. Faces get relighted to make them look more even and the iPhone knows to sharpen up your facial hair. Smart HDR is also less aggressive in flattening the photos. Highlights and faces aren't corrected as aggressively as before because those highlights make photos look more natural. But other highlights and shadows are corrected to regain detail. Finally, the whole image is saved and you've got a photo. This all happens instantly every time you take a photo, which is a testament to how powerful Apple's A13 processor really is. Here's that final image we just took. You can see how the iPhone 11 preserves more detail than the Pixel and Note in the shadows and highlights, and just blows the iPhone XS away in sharpness. The improvements to Smart HDR are applicable across cameras. Here's a quick comparison of the ultra-wides in the 11 Pro and the Note 10. The Note 10 did a better job exposing the sky, but the 11 is just a much sharper photo with more detail. You can see the same thing with selfies. The XS Max has pulled up shadows so much that it looks a little hazy, while the iPhone 11 evenly pulls up shadows in Mariya's face, but preserves the contrast with the background. The Note 10 did all kinds of goofy skin smoothing and the Pixel 3 looks great, but it has less detail than the iPhone. Just look at her eyelashes. Now there are places where the iPhone 11 didn't win in our tests. The XS historically struggled with backlit subjects. And while the 11 is a definite improvement, this photo is really blue. And there's basically no detail in Mariya's face. I think the Note actually did the best overall job here. And I think the Pixel does the best job in low light, but the iPhone isn't bad. It's a lot better than the XS was last year. Apple's promised a new mode for these situations called Deep Fusion, which is supposed to ship later this year, but I wasn't able to test it. If it improves photos taken in this kind of light, then the iPhone will basically pull ahead in every situation. Apple also added a Night mode this year and it's really impressive. It preserves a ton more detail than the Pixel. It comes on automatically in the dark and suggests an exposure time, which you can tweak or turn off if you want. The Pixel photo here looks more dramatic, but look a little closer. The iPhone has preserved all of the detail in the brick and graffiti, which is basically gone in the Pixel shot. Both of these Night mode photos look pretty similar, but look at all the extra detail in the bushes in the iPhone shot. Same with this shot. You'd never know that fence was even there in the Pixel photo. I think the Pixel produces more dramatic-looking shots out of the camera, but I would rather have the extra detail from the iPhone. All in all, I think the iPhone 11 camera does better in bright light than the Pixel 3 and Note 10, and the Night mode beats the Pixel 3 more often than not. If this promised Deep Fusion update improves medium- to low-light performance as much as Apple says it will, the iPhone 11 will once again be the smartphone camera to beat. Apple's also made video on the iPhone 11 better with improved stabilization exposure and the ability to record 4K60 video from any of the three cameras. - But is it really that good? Let's put it to the test. Alright, so we're going to head out in New York City and we're going to test against the Note 10, the Pixel 3, and the XS to see who does video best. We started out at the water and immediately you can see the color differences between the cameras. The Pixel leaned into the warm tones, while Samsung muddied the mid tones. And the iPhone XS leaned into the blues of the sky, while the 11 Pro balanced the warm and cool tones out the most. With the subject closer to the lens the Note 10 kept the flowers the sharpest, while the iPhone XS blurred the background the most. Okay, we've got to test the audio on all these phones. I'll let you guys be the judge. Do I sound like the beautiful angel voice that I have, angelic voice? Of course, the answer is yes. But on these phones, who's to say? In low light, Apple isn't afraid of underexposing the blacks, whereas Samsung and Google will bring them up. Now the 11 Pro does do a lot more smoothing to compensate for all of the noise this typically creates. The front-facing camera on the iPhone 11 Pro did a great job of balancing my skin tone and just the exposure in general. Even against this large neon light source. But it wasn't as sharp as the Note 10. Now all these comparisons are great, but chances are you won't be recording on all of these phones side by side at the same exact time. So let's just talk about the iPhone 11 Pro. The front-facing camera now records in 4K and the slofie is exactly how you'd imagine it. You'll use it once and probably never touch it again. The video from the rear cameras, though, is really good. Like, in perfect light, it's honestly just impressive. Switching between lenses is pretty seamless in terms of color accuracy and exposure. And you can use the dial method or just tap the lenses on the screen to switch. Now you can't switch between lenses when you shoot in 4K60. So make sure you set 4K30 or lower if you're going to be doing that. The ultra-wide angle lens looks super cool even with the crazy distortion. But there is no image stabilization, which shouldn't be a problem because naturally, the wider the lens, the less need for that. Both the telephoto and wide lens keep your shot stable and pretty sharp for a sensor their size. The color is punchy and pretty saturated and in perfect lighting, you, too, can have that shot on iPhone look. But in low light, even the iPhone 11 Pro, when viewed on a screen larger than its own, succumbs to noisy blacks and haloed highlights. My big issue, though, why do I have to leave the camera app to change the frame rates? It's not intuitive and it's just time-consuming. Apple, just put it in the app. iPhones have always had great video, but the video on the 11 Pro is the best I've seen on a smartphone to date. And the gap is only getting bigger. Enough of me, back to Nilay. - The screen on the iPhone 11 Pro is a new OLED that Apple is calling the Super Retina XDR display. There's still a notch and Apple is still doing fancy, rounded corners and uniform bezels, which no one else in the industry has really managed to match. Those bezels are still pretty big, though, especially compared to something like the Galaxy Note 10. This is the third year of the basic iPhone X design and Apple's competitors haven't been sitting still in trying to beat it. The big upgrades to the screen are around brightness and power efficiency. Basically, the screen can get a lot brighter than before and it also uses up to 15 percent less power, according to Apple. Now in typical situations, Apple says the iPhone 11 Pro display can go up to 800 nits of brightness and that when you're watching HDR content, the highlights will peak at 1,200 nits. In normal situations, I don't think you're going to notice it. I've never had a problem looking at my iPhone XS display outside. But it's a huge and obvious improvement when you're watching HDR movies. I never really bought the idea that previous iPhone displays were Dolby Vision, but the iPhone 11 Pro display kind of pulls it off. It's hard to capture this on video, but it's just a lot brighter and punchier on the 11 Pro display compared to the XS. The Note 10 display definitely looks as bright, but the iPhone's color processing looks way more natural to me, especially with Apple's True Tone system turned on. Of course, Apple and Google are still in a fight over video codecs, so you can't watch any 4K or HDR content on the iPhone 11 Pro from YouTube. So this video is not in 4K if you're watching on an iPhone. Sorry about that. Apple has also updated the audio on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, with something they're calling spatial audio. It's basically a surround decoder. If you're watching a Netflix movie with Adobe 5.1 sound or game encoded in 7.1, you'll get virtual surround from the stereo speakers. The iPhone 11s also support Dolby Atmos, which is a little silly for stereo speakers, but it's there. There's also standard wide stereo support like last year for everything else. All in all, the iPhone speakers sound really loud and generally better than ever. There's no more 3D Touch on the iPhone 11 Pro, it's been replaced by what Apple calls Haptic Touch, which is basically just long pressing on things with haptic feedback. In most places, you won't really notice it's gone and some things are actually a little easier to figure out. Opening the camera from the lock screen feels the same to me. Rearranging icons on the home screen is a little simpler to figure out since there's a context menu that pops up now. Peeking at links in Safari is a little different in iOS 13, but it's also a little simpler. The only place I truly missed 3D Touch was the keyboard. You could press down anywhere on the keyboard to move the cursor around on the XS, but with Haptic Touch you can only press and hold on the space bar. Now, I never really realized how many times a day I used that one specific 3D Touch feature and I missed it. But if the trade-off is that there's more room inside the case for a bigger battery, I'm fine with it. Apple claims the iPhone 11 Pro lasts four hours longer than the iPhone XS, and that the iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts five hours longer than the XS Max. As I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to test those claims. Apple doesn't run a strict battery test that we can just repeat. Instead, it's getting that number by taking its huge data set of iPhone usage and applying it to a model of the new phone. So you'll notice that the only hard numbers Apple publishes are like hours of video playback. Simple tests of a single task, which isn't how anyone uses a phone. All that said, the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro has been impressive. I've been using an 11 Pro Max as my primary phone for the past week, and it has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge. And about 10 hours of screen-on time, off the charger, is reported in battery settings. That is a huge improvement over my XS Max, which generally runs for eight to nine hours The smaller 11 Pro has been just as impressive. That's the phone Becca used for her testing and it still had 50 percent of its battery left the morning after she shot her part of the review. It turns out a slightly thicker phone with a bigger battery was the right move after all. Inside the new iPhone 11 Pro, there's the new A13 Bionic processor which, as usual, benchmarks far above the competition. There's a lot of headroom here for things like AR, games, and high-end photo and video apps, but it's not like the A12 Bionic in the iPhone XS is slow. Most of this extra power will be useful towards the end of this phone's life, not the beginning. Face ID is a little bit faster and works at more angles, but it's not particularly dramatic, it just works a little bit better. I think this is the best kind of iterative update. It made a thing that was already pretty good a little bit better, and anything that makes securing your phone a little bit better is great. And most intriguingly, there's a new chip inside the iPhone 11, it's called the U1, which does precise positioning using an ultra wideband radio. Apple says the forthcoming iOS 13.1 update will allow you to just point the phone at another U1 device to put it at the top of your AirDrop list. But none of that works yet, so we'll just have to see. Obviously, the iPhone 11 Pro runs iOS 13 and I have to tell you, iOS 13 is pretty buggy. I saw all kinds of glitches and crashes during my week of testing, and iOS 13.1 is already in beta and scheduled for wide release by the end of this month. So it really seems like Apple just squeaked this thing out the door and is racing to fix bugs. I asked Apple about some of these glitches and they told me they're always fixing bugs and iPhone owners generally auto update. But if you're on the fence about upgrading, you might want to wait until some of these bug fix updates actually ship. Assuming all the bugs get fixed, the biggest new feature in iOS 13 is Dark Mode, which is very nice. But otherwise, this is a lot of tiny little updates. There's a swiping keyboard now. Reminders is a much better app. There are better photo editing tools and you can edit videos as well. Apple Maps keeps getting a tiny bit better every year. Siri's voice is slightly smoother. It's a lot of little things that add up into a big update, but if you handed this phone to someone using iOS 12, they might not even notice unless Dark Mode was on. The iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999 with 64GB of storage, which doesn't seem like quite enough for that price. And the 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099. You can spec the Pro Max all the way up to $1,449 with 512GB of storage, which means that you can pay an awful lot of money for this phone if you want to. If you're in the iOS ecosystem and it's time to upgrade, it's a pretty tough choice this year. The standard iPhone 11 offers almost everything you get from the Pro for $699. And I think most people should get the iPhone 11. You'll still get the improved main camera, the fun new ultra-wide lens, the A13 processor, and iOS 13, and all the rest. The extra money for the Pro basically buys you a far superior display, a telephoto camera, and improved LTE performance. And if you want a smaller phone, the iPhone 11 Pro is a little bit smaller than the iPhone 11, which seems a tiny bit unfair to people who want a smaller phone. The entire lineup is still pretty big, though. So if you're hoping for something to replace that aging iPhone SE, you're not going to love any of these options. I'm very picky about displays and cameras, so I'm going to get an iPhone 11 Pro. In fact, the cameras on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are so improved that I think they're worth the year-over-year upgrade from last year's models for the first time in a long time. Add in the improved battery life and the iPhone 11 Pro stands out as a major step forward from the XS and one of the best flagship phones of the year. Or it will be, when Apple fixes iOS 13. Hey everybody, this was obviously the iPhone 11 Pro review. We also reviewed the iPhone 11, that was a fun collab we did with Dieter Bohn. Watch both videos, they're both on the channel, and then let me know which of these phones you think you're going to buy or if you're waiting for the Pixel 4.\""

      "iPhone 11 Pro Max is a bad name.\n",
      "Of course, Apple and Google are still in a fight over video codecs, so you can't watch any 4K or HDR content on the iPhone 11 Pro from YouTube.\n",
      "I never really bought the idea that previous iPhone displays were Dolby Vision, but the iPhone 11 Pro display kind of pulls it off.\n",
      "The standard iPhone 11 offers almost everything you get from the Pro for $699.\n",
      "The iPhone 11 is the reverse.\n",
      "Inside the new iPhone 11 Pro, there's the new A13 Bionic processor which, as usual, benchmarks far above the competition.\n",
      "The XS Max has pulled up shadows so much that it looks a little hazy, while the iPhone 11 evenly pulls up shadows in Mariya's face, but preserves the contrast with the background.\n",
      "If it improves photos taken in this kind of light, then the iPhone will basically pull ahead in every situation.\n",
      "Instead, it's getting that number by taking its huge data set of iPhone usage and applying it to a model of the new phone.\n",
      "The iPhone 11s also support Dolby Atmos, which is a little silly for stereo speakers, but it's there.\n",
      "Apple claims the iPhone 11 Pro lasts four hours longer than the iPhone XS, and that the iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts five hours longer than the XS Max.\n",
      "All in all, the iPhone speakers sound really loud and generally better than ever.\n",
      "In fact, the cameras on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are so improved that I think they're worth the year-over-year upgrade from last year's models for the first time in a long time.\n",
      "I've never had a problem looking at my iPhone XS display outside.\n",
      "The color is punchy and pretty saturated and in perfect lighting, you, too, can have that shot on iPhone look.\n",
      "But in low light, even the iPhone 11 Pro, when viewed on a screen larger than its own, succumbs to noisy blacks and haloed highlights.\n",
      "There are three cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro.\n",
      "And if you want a smaller phone, the iPhone 11 Pro is a little bit smaller than the iPhone 11, which seems a tiny bit unfair to people who want a smaller phone.\n",
      "The iPhone 11 is way sharper, with way more detail.\n",
      "This is all basically the same as the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3, except the Pixel doesn't grab that overexposed frame.\n",
      "You can see how the iPhone 11 preserves more detail than the Pixel and Note in the shadows and highlights, and just blows the iPhone XS away in sharpness.\n",
      "There's no more 3D Touch on the iPhone 11 Pro, it's been replaced by what Apple calls Haptic Touch, which is basically just long pressing on things with haptic feedback.\n",
      "So this video is not in 4K if you're watching on an iPhone.\n",
      "I'm very picky about displays and cameras, so I'm going to get an iPhone 11 Pro.\n",
      "The iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n",
      "We also reviewed the iPhone 11, that was a fun collab we did with Dieter Bohn.\n",
      "- Alright, it's iPhone time.\n",
      "The front-facing camera on the iPhone 11 Pro did a great job of balancing my skin tone and just the exposure in general.\n",
      "The Note 10 did all kinds of goofy skin smoothing and the Pixel 3 looks great, but it has less detail than the iPhone.\n",
      "If this promised Deep Fusion update improves medium- to low-light performance as much as Apple says it will, the iPhone 11 will once again be the smartphone camera to beat.\n",
      "With the subject closer to the lens the Note 10 kept the flowers the sharpest, while the iPhone XS blurred the background the most.\n",
      "This is the third year of the basic iPhone X design and Apple's competitors haven't been sitting still in trying to beat it.\n",
      "They're basically just nice updates to the iPhone XS, but I also think it's a waste of time to argue about names.\n",
      "Faces get relighted to make them look more even and the iPhone knows to sharpen up your facial hair.\n",
      "Obviously, the iPhone 11 Pro runs iOS 13\n",
      "So if you're hoping for something to replace that aging iPhone SE, you're not going to love any of these options.\n",
      "There's a lot of headroom here for things like AR, games, and high-end photo and video apps, but it's not like the A12 Bionic in the iPhone XS is slow.\n",
      "Now there are places where the iPhone 11 didn't win in our tests.\n",
      "All in all, I think the iPhone 11 camera does better in bright light than the Pixel 3 and Note 10, and the Night mode beats the Pixel 3 more often than not.\n",
      "Hey everybody, this was obviously the iPhone 11 Pro review.\n",
      "And I think the Pixel does the best job in low light, but the iPhone isn't bad.\n",
      "But zoom and do 100 percent crop and the improvement from the iPhone XS to the iPhone 11 main camera is stunning.\n",
      "The screen on the iPhone 11 Pro is a new OLED that Apple is calling the Super Retina XDR display.\n",
      "I also think the iPhone 11 does a way better job than the Note 10 and it's a little better to my eye than the Pixel 3.\n",
      "First, the iPhone starts taking photos to a buffer the instant you open the camera app.\n",
      "Apple has also updated the audio on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, with something they're calling spatial audio.\n",
      "And I think most people should get the iPhone 11.\n",
      "Now, I honestly think the iPhone 11 is the phone most people in the iOS ecosystem should get if they're upgrading.\n",
      "Now in typical situations, Apple says the iPhone 11 Pro display can go up to 800 nits of brightness and that when you're watching HDR content, the highlights will peak at 1,200 nits.\n",
      "So let's just talk about the iPhone 11 Pro.\n",
      "The iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999 with 64GB of storage, which doesn't seem like quite enough for that price.\n",
      "Add in the improved battery life and the iPhone 11 Pro stands out as a major step forward from the XS and one of the best flagship phones of the year.\n",
      "Both of these Night mode photos look pretty similar, but look at all the extra detail in the bushes in the iPhone shot.\n",
      "All that said, the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro has been impressive.\n",
      "And most intriguingly, there's a new chip inside the iPhone 11, it's called the U1, which does precise positioning using an ultra wideband radio.\n",
      "Apple's also made video on the iPhone 11 better with improved stabilization exposure and the ability to record 4K60 video from any of the three cameras.\n",
      "Google and Samsung's cameras have been outperforming the iPhone for a couple of years now.\n",
      "Apple's also updated its smart HDR processing system, which I was not very impressed with when I reviewed the iPhone XS and XR.\n",
      "It didn't really pick up any fingerprints, but it does seem a tiny bit more slippery than the gloss back of the previous phones and the iPhone 11.\n",
      "I asked Apple about some of these glitches and they told me they're always fixing bugs and iPhone owners generally auto update.\n",
      "And the iPhone XS leaned into the blues of the sky, while the 11 Pro balanced the warm and cool tones out the most.\n",
      "The iPhone 11 cameras are an enormous improvement over the XS, and beat the Pixel and Galaxy Note 10 in most of our tests.\n",
      "I think the Pixel produces more dramatic-looking shots out of the camera, but I would rather have the extra detail from the iPhone.\n",
      "The iPhone has preserved all of the detail in the brick and graffiti, which is basically gone in the Pixel shot.\n",
      "The Note 10 display definitely looks as bright, but the iPhone's color processing looks way more natural to me, especially with Apple's True Tone system turned on.\n"

    "text = \"- Alright, it's iPhone time. Apple released three new iPhones all at once this year. The iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Now, I honestly think the iPhone 11 is the phone most people in the iOS ecosystem should get if they're upgrading. So we've got a whole other review of that phone that you should check out, too. But this, this is the Pro review. The dark mode, cash money review for professionals who use their phones to do pro stuff. Like taking telephoto photos. Actually, I have no idea why Apple called these phones Pro. They're basically just nice updates to the iPhone XS, but I also think it's a waste of time to argue about names. iPhone 11 Pro Max is a bad name. But you know what, it's a great phone. And I think Apple might have done it. This is the best camera I've ever seen on a phone. Let's get into it. (calming music) The iPhone 11 Pro looks almost exactly like the iPhone XS from the front. It's a little heavier and thicker, but unless you're comparing them directly, you probably won't notice. I certainly didn't. You do get a much bigger battery in exchange for that extra size, which Apple says leads to a four-hour battery life increase on the regular Pro and a five-hour jump for the Pro Max. But it's surprisingly hard to check that number. I'll get into why in a minute. The big difference from the XS comes on the back where Apple says the rear glass is now stronger and it comes in this frosted matte finish. It also integrates a glossy camera bump with three cameras. The whole back and the bump is a single piece of glass that's milled out. The iPhone 11 is the reverse. It has a glossy back and the camera bump is matte. Now you know. I got a lot of questions about this matte finish and I think it's really nice, especially in this new midnight green color. It didn't really pick up any fingerprints, but it does seem a tiny bit more slippery than the gloss back of the previous phones and the iPhone 11. But I also think most people are just going to stick this thing in a case, so it doesn't seem like a huge issue. A lot of people also asked me if this matte finish will scratch easily, similar to the back of the Pixel 3, and so far the answer seems to be no. But we're going to have to keep an eye on it over time. Apple's finally relented and included an 18W USB-C fast charger with the Pro phones. So you get a USB-C to Lightning cable as well. Now Apple's USB-C charger is not the smallest or prettiest charger out there. But anything is better than the slow 5W brick it's been including for years, so I'll take it. So let's get into these cameras. Apple has a lot at stake here. Google and Samsung's cameras have been outperforming the iPhone for a couple of years now. And Chinese phone makers, in particular, have been racing each other to add an endless array of photography features. If you're in the US, you're probably locked into iMessage and no camera is good enough to make you switch. But Apple doesn't have that advantage in big markets like Europe and China. Everyone uses WhatsApp and WeChat, and switching from iOS to Android is much easier. So Apple's added a bunch of features that first appeared on Android phones. There are three cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro. The telephoto camera has the same basic sensor, but a faster f/2.O lens. The main camera has the same f/1.8 lens and a slightly better sensor. And there's the new super fun ultra-wide camera, which is basically twice as wide as the main lens and f/2.4. And the f/2.2 front camera is now 12 megapixels, up from seven, and has a wider 24mm focal length so it can pull out to a slightly wider angle in landscape for selfies. Apple's also updated its smart HDR processing system, which I was not very impressed with when I reviewed the iPhone XS and XR. The iPhone 11 cameras are an enormous improvement over the XS, and beat the Pixel and Galaxy Note 10 in most of our tests. This shot of Verge video producer, Mariya Abdulkaf, outside in bright sunlight shouldn't be too hard for any camera to do a good job with. And all these photos look basically fine. But zoom and do 100 percent crop and the improvement from the iPhone XS to the iPhone 11 main camera is stunning. The iPhone 11 is way sharper, with way more detail. I also think the iPhone 11 does a way better job than the Note 10 and it's a little better to my eye than the Pixel 3. This improvement is due to something Apple's calling semantic rendering. Basically, Smart HDR recognizes what's in the image and renders it appropriately. I asked Apple to break down how it works for me and it basically goes like this: First, the iPhone starts taking photos to a buffer the instant you open the camera app. So by the time you actually press the button, it's captured four underexposed frames and the photo you want. Then it grabs one overexposed frame. This is all basically the same as the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3, except the Pixel doesn't grab that overexposed frame. Second, Smart HDR and semantic rendering then start looking for things in the photos it understands. Faces, hair, the sky, things like that. Then it uses additional detail from the under and overexposed frames to selectively process the areas of the image it's recognized. Hair gets sharpened, but the sky doesn't. It just gets de-noised. Faces get relighted to make them look more even and the iPhone knows to sharpen up your facial hair. Smart HDR is also less aggressive in flattening the photos. Highlights and faces aren't corrected as aggressively as before because those highlights make photos look more natural. But other highlights and shadows are corrected to regain detail. Finally, the whole image is saved and you've got a photo. This all happens instantly every time you take a photo, which is a testament to how powerful Apple's A13 processor really is. Here's that final image we just took. You can see how the iPhone 11 preserves more detail than the Pixel and Note in the shadows and highlights, and just blows the iPhone XS away in sharpness. The improvements to Smart HDR are applicable across cameras. Here's a quick comparison of the ultra-wides in the 11 Pro and the Note 10. The Note 10 did a better job exposing the sky, but the 11 is just a much sharper photo with more detail. You can see the same thing with selfies. The XS Max has pulled up shadows so much that it looks a little hazy, while the iPhone 11 evenly pulls up shadows in Mariya's face, but preserves the contrast with the background. The Note 10 did all kinds of goofy skin smoothing and the Pixel 3 looks great, but it has less detail than the iPhone. Just look at her eyelashes. Now there are places where the iPhone 11 didn't win in our tests. The XS historically struggled with backlit subjects. And while the 11 is a definite improvement, this photo is really blue. And there's basically no detail in Mariya's face. I think the Note actually did the best overall job here. And I think the Pixel does the best job in low light, but the iPhone isn't bad. It's a lot better than the XS was last year. Apple's promised a new mode for these situations called Deep Fusion, which is supposed to ship later this year, but I wasn't able to test it. If it improves photos taken in this kind of light, then the iPhone will basically pull ahead in every situation. Apple also added a Night mode this year and it's really impressive. It preserves a ton more detail than the Pixel. It comes on automatically in the dark and suggests an exposure time, which you can tweak or turn off if you want. The Pixel photo here looks more dramatic, but look a little closer. The iPhone has preserved all of the detail in the brick and graffiti, which is basically gone in the Pixel shot. Both of these Night mode photos look pretty similar, but look at all the extra detail in the bushes in the iPhone shot. Same with this shot. You'd never know that fence was even there in the Pixel photo. I think the Pixel produces more dramatic-looking shots out of the camera, but I would rather have the extra detail from the iPhone. All in all, I think the iPhone 11 camera does better in bright light than the Pixel 3 and Note 10, and the Night mode beats the Pixel 3 more often than not. If this promised Deep Fusion update improves medium- to low-light performance as much as Apple says it will, the iPhone 11 will once again be the smartphone camera to beat. Apple's also made video on the iPhone 11 better with improved stabilization exposure and the ability to record 4K60 video from any of the three cameras. - But is it really that good? Let's put it to the test. Alright, so we're going to head out in New York City and we're going to test against the Note 10, the Pixel 3, and the XS to see who does video best. We started out at the water and immediately you can see the color differences between the cameras. The Pixel leaned into the warm tones, while Samsung muddied the mid tones. And the iPhone XS leaned into the blues of the sky, while the 11 Pro balanced the warm and cool tones out the most. With the subject closer to the lens the Note 10 kept the flowers the sharpest, while the iPhone XS blurred the background the most. Okay, we've got to test the audio on all these phones. I'll let you guys be the judge. Do I sound like the beautiful angel voice that I have, angelic voice? Of course, the answer is yes. But on these phones, who's to say? In low light, Apple isn't afraid of underexposing the blacks, whereas Samsung and Google will bring them up. Now the 11 Pro does do a lot more smoothing to compensate for all of the noise this typically creates. The front-facing camera on the iPhone 11 Pro did a great job of balancing my skin tone and just the exposure in general. Even against this large neon light source. But it wasn't as sharp as the Note 10. Now all these comparisons are great, but chances are you won't be recording on all of these phones side by side at the same exact time. So let's just talk about the iPhone 11 Pro. The front-facing camera now records in 4K and the slofie is exactly how you'd imagine it. You'll use it once and probably never touch it again. The video from the rear cameras, though, is really good. Like, in perfect light, it's honestly just impressive. Switching between lenses is pretty seamless in terms of color accuracy and exposure. And you can use the dial method or just tap the lenses on the screen to switch. Now you can't switch between lenses when you shoot in 4K60. So make sure you set 4K30 or lower if you're going to be doing that. The ultra-wide angle lens looks super cool even with the crazy distortion. But there is no image stabilization, which shouldn't be a problem because naturally, the wider the lens, the less need for that. Both the telephoto and wide lens keep your shot stable and pretty sharp for a sensor their size. The color is punchy and pretty saturated and in perfect lighting, you, too, can have that shot on iPhone look. But in low light, even the iPhone 11 Pro, when viewed on a screen larger than its own, succumbs to noisy blacks and haloed highlights. My big issue, though, why do I have to leave the camera app to change the frame rates? It's not intuitive and it's just time-consuming. Apple, just put it in the app. iPhones have always had great video, but the video on the 11 Pro is the best I've seen on a smartphone to date. And the gap is only getting bigger. Enough of me, back to Nilay. - The screen on the iPhone 11 Pro is a new OLED that Apple is calling the Super Retina XDR display. There's still a notch and Apple is still doing fancy, rounded corners and uniform bezels, which no one else in the industry has really managed to match. Those bezels are still pretty big, though, especially compared to something like the Galaxy Note 10. This is the third year of the basic iPhone X design and Apple's competitors haven't been sitting still in trying to beat it. The big upgrades to the screen are around brightness and power efficiency. Basically, the screen can get a lot brighter than before and it also uses up to 15 percent less power, according to Apple. Now in typical situations, Apple says the iPhone 11 Pro display can go up to 800 nits of brightness and that when you're watching HDR content, the highlights will peak at 1,200 nits. In normal situations, I don't think you're going to notice it. I've never had a problem looking at my iPhone XS display outside. But it's a huge and obvious improvement when you're watching HDR movies. I never really bought the idea that previous iPhone displays were Dolby Vision, but the iPhone 11 Pro display kind of pulls it off. It's hard to capture this on video, but it's just a lot brighter and punchier on the 11 Pro display compared to the XS. The Note 10 display definitely looks as bright, but the iPhone's color processing looks way more natural to me, especially with Apple's True Tone system turned on. Of course, Apple and Google are still in a fight over video codecs, so you can't watch any 4K or HDR content on the iPhone 11 Pro from YouTube. So this video is not in 4K if you're watching on an iPhone. Sorry about that. Apple has also updated the audio on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, with something they're calling spatial audio. It's basically a surround decoder. If you're watching a Netflix movie with Adobe 5.1 sound or game encoded in 7.1, you'll get virtual surround from the stereo speakers. The iPhone 11s also support Dolby Atmos, which is a little silly for stereo speakers, but it's there. There's also standard wide stereo support like last year for everything else. All in all, the iPhone speakers sound really loud and generally better than ever. There's no more 3D Touch on the iPhone 11 Pro, it's been replaced by what Apple calls Haptic Touch, which is basically just long pressing on things with haptic feedback. In most places, you won't really notice it's gone and some things are actually a little easier to figure out. Opening the camera from the lock screen feels the same to me. Rearranging icons on the home screen is a little simpler to figure out since there's a context menu that pops up now. Peeking at links in Safari is a little different in iOS 13, but it's also a little simpler. The only place I truly missed 3D Touch was the keyboard. You could press down anywhere on the keyboard to move the cursor around on the XS, but with Haptic Touch you can only press and hold on the space bar. Now, I never really realized how many times a day I used that one specific 3D Touch feature and I missed it. But if the trade-off is that there's more room inside the case for a bigger battery, I'm fine with it. Apple claims the iPhone 11 Pro lasts four hours longer than the iPhone XS, and that the iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts five hours longer than the XS Max. As I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to test those claims. Apple doesn't run a strict battery test that we can just repeat. Instead, it's getting that number by taking its huge data set of iPhone usage and applying it to a model of the new phone. So you'll notice that the only hard numbers Apple publishes are like hours of video playback. Simple tests of a single task, which isn't how anyone uses a phone. All that said, the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro has been impressive. I've been using an 11 Pro Max as my primary phone for the past week, and it has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge. And about 10 hours of screen-on time, off the charger, is reported in battery settings. That is a huge improvement over my XS Max, which generally runs for eight to nine hours The smaller 11 Pro has been just as impressive. That's the phone Becca used for her testing and it still had 50 percent of its battery left the morning after she shot her part of the review. It turns out a slightly thicker phone with a bigger battery was the right move after all. Inside the new iPhone 11 Pro, there's the new A13 Bionic processor which, as usual, benchmarks far above the competition. There's a lot of headroom here for things like AR, games, and high-end photo and video apps, but it's not like the A12 Bionic in the iPhone XS is slow. Most of this extra power will be useful towards the end of this phone's life, not the beginning. Face ID is a little bit faster and works at more angles, but it's not particularly dramatic, it just works a little bit better. I think this is the best kind of iterative update. It made a thing that was already pretty good a little bit better, and anything that makes securing your phone a little bit better is great. And most intriguingly, there's a new chip inside the iPhone 11, it's called the U1, which does precise positioning using an ultra wideband radio. Apple says the forthcoming iOS 13.1 update will allow you to just point the phone at another U1 device to put it at the top of your AirDrop list. But none of that works yet, so we'll just have to see. Obviously, the iPhone 11 Pro runs iOS 13 and I have to tell you, iOS 13 is pretty buggy. I saw all kinds of glitches and crashes during my week of testing, and iOS 13.1 is already in beta and scheduled for wide release by the end of this month. So it really seems like Apple just squeaked this thing out the door and is racing to fix bugs. I asked Apple about some of these glitches and they told me they're always fixing bugs and iPhone owners generally auto update. But if you're on the fence about upgrading, you might want to wait until some of these bug fix updates actually ship. Assuming all the bugs get fixed, the biggest new feature in iOS 13 is Dark Mode, which is very nice. But otherwise, this is a lot of tiny little updates. There's a swiping keyboard now. Reminders is a much better app. There are better photo editing tools and you can edit videos as well. Apple Maps keeps getting a tiny bit better every year. Siri's voice is slightly smoother. It's a lot of little things that add up into a big update, but if you handed this phone to someone using iOS 12, they might not even notice unless Dark Mode was on. The iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999 with 64GB of storage, which doesn't seem like quite enough for that price. And the 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099. You can spec the Pro Max all the way up to $1,449 with 512GB of storage, which means that you can pay an awful lot of money for this phone if you want to. If you're in the iOS ecosystem and it's time to upgrade, it's a pretty tough choice this year. The standard iPhone 11 offers almost everything you get from the Pro for $699. And I think most people should get the iPhone 11. You'll still get the improved main camera, the fun new ultra-wide lens, the A13 processor, and iOS 13, and all the rest. The extra money for the Pro basically buys you a far superior display, a telephoto camera, and improved LTE performance. And if you want a smaller phone, the iPhone 11 Pro is a little bit smaller than the iPhone 11, which seems a tiny bit unfair to people who want a smaller phone. The entire lineup is still pretty big, though. So if you're hoping for something to replace that aging iPhone SE, you're not going to love any of these options. I'm very picky about displays and cameras, so I'm going to get an iPhone 11 Pro. In fact, the cameras on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are so improved that I think they're worth the year-over-year upgrade from last year's models for the first time in a long time. Add in the improved battery life and the iPhone 11 Pro stands out as a major step forward from the XS and one of the best flagship phones of the year. Or it will be, when Apple fixes iOS 13. Hey everybody, this was obviously the iPhone 11 Pro review. We also reviewed the iPhone 11, that was a fun collab we did with Dieter Bohn. Watch both videos, they're both on the channel, and then let me know which of these phones you think you're going to buy or if you're waiting for the Pixel 4.\"\n",

      "Both of these Night mode photos look pretty similar, but look at all the extra detail in the bushes in the iPhone shot.\n",
      "All that said, the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro has been impressive.\n",
      "And most intriguingly, there's a new chip inside the iPhone 11, it's called the U1, which does precise positioning using an ultra wideband radio.\n",
      "Apple's also made video on the iPhone 11 better with improved stabilization exposure and the ability to record 4K60 video from any of the three cameras.\n",
      "Google and Samsung's cameras have been outperforming the iPhone for a couple of years now.\n",
      "Apple's also updated its smart HDR processing system, which I was not very impressed with when I reviewed the iPhone XS and XR.\n",
      "It didn't really pick up any fingerprints, but it does seem a tiny bit more slippery than the gloss back of the previous phones and the iPhone 11.\n",
      "I asked Apple about some of these glitches and they told me they're always fixing bugs and iPhone owners generally auto update.\n",
      "And the iPhone XS leaned into the blues of the sky, while the 11 Pro balanced the warm and cool tones out the most.\n",
      "The iPhone 11 cameras are an enormous improvement over the XS, and beat the Pixel and Galaxy Note 10 in most of our tests.\n",
      "I think the Pixel produces more dramatic-looking shots out of the camera, but I would rather have the extra detail from the iPhone.\n",
      "The iPhone has preserved all of the detail in the brick and graffiti, which is basically gone in the Pixel shot.\n",
      "The Note 10 display definitely looks as bright, but the iPhone's color processing looks way more natural to me, especially with Apple's True Tone system turned on.\n"
