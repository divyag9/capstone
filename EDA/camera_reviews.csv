2753165,12473447,3,False,B00N462AQE,The camera is absolutely perfect for me. Everything with the exception of the Wide Angle / Macro and Telephoto lens worked. The adapters included for these to fit a Canon EF camera were too big or too small. Big dissapointment.
2753166,12473448,5,True,B00N462AQE,My daughter loves it!  It was everything she wanted and more!
2753167,12473449,4,True,B00N462AQE,The camera is fantastic. All the extra accessories are low quality.
2753168,12473450,5,True,B00N462AQE,"very nice camera, we are very happy we chose the t5i, and also we up also upgraded to the 18-135 lens."
2753169,12473451,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great package deal for those entering the world of more than point and shoot!
2753170,12473452,5,True,B00N462AQE,Enjoying my new Camera!
2753171,12473453,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I was hesitant to order from this seller due to past reviews that indicated the products in the package were not Polaroid brand. But I took a gamble and it paid off. Everything in the package was exactly as described. My wife was extremely happy. As someone who is brand new to photography, this is a great starter set, containing everything she will need to learn the trade. Feel free to ping me with questions."
2753172,12473454,4,True,B00N462AQE,EXCELENTE PRODUCTS
2753173,12473455,2,True,B00N462AQE,It came with all these lenses but it's a canon camera and Polaroid lens are not fitting on it
2753174,12473456,5,True,B00N462AQE,just as described not all products matched but everything stated did come it just might not have been the same brand.
2753175,12473457,4,True,B00N462AQE,"The camera is great and works well.  Some of the accessories don't fit the camera, like the flash.  Over all, it's still a decent price and it was delivered quickly."
2753176,12473458,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Great camera, all accessories came as they supposed, everything Polaroid brand and fits the camera."
2753177,12473459,5,True,B00N462AQE,"For everything I got this is a really good value.  Not everything is name brand, but so far everything works together really well.  I am very happy with this camera and every piece of the set I have used!!! I would recommend this to a friend."
2753178,12473460,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Great camera! A few accessories are unnecessary and probably will never be used, but overall I'm very happy with the camera!"
2753179,12473461,5,True,B00N462AQE,It was a steal. I shoot music videos with it. I shoot events. Its great i just need extra batteries.
2753180,12473462,5,True,B00N462AQE,The Canon EOS REbel T5i camera is an excellent addition to the field of photography...easy to use with professional results.
2753181,12473463,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great camera. It arrived on time with all the accessories showed in the picture. Highly recommended!
2753182,12473464,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I loved it!!!! Thanks Tom, for everything!!!! Everything came exactly as described!!!"
2753183,12473465,5,True,B00N462AQE,Camera is great. Brand new in the box. All th extras made it worth it to buy on Amazon.
2753184,12473466,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Camera and lenses are great, some of the accessories and cheap and of little value, makes the package look better than it really was."
2753185,12473467,5,True,B00N462AQE,Every in the kit came - as ordered.  We use this camera extensively and it is great
2753186,12473468,5,True,B00N462AQE,i compared to other cameras of similar cost . i  found the T5i was a better buy . i used it for our vacation to mt Rushmore .. and the pictures are professional quality . and i'm not a professional.but over all i recamend it .
2753187,12473469,4,False,B00N462AQE,"The 3 extra lenses and filters DO NOT fit the camera. However for the price, all of the extras made up for this. ugh, oh well"
2753188,12473470,3,True,B00N462AQE,"The Camera actually gets a 4......The camera is great, takes excellent pics and i love the EOS utility, the cons are listed below.

The bundle items are pretty much cheap junk to just fill and fluff!!!!! I am a novice photographer and the T5I is overkill for what I need. I bought the bundle because it seemed like a good deal.....the majority of the items in the bundle are cheap junk and just a mix or miss-match of Hodge Podge assortment of ""non-Canon"" items. Memory chips.....too small, tri pods......very cheap flimsy junk, lens cleaning kit....cheap junk, camera case....too small (had to buy a larger one), sd to usb convertor.... already have 2 or 3.....plus every computer already has one, external flash......camera already has a sufficient flash, filters.......ehh.....might be useful, remote control.....haven't used it yet but will probably be very useful. So...... i probably should have just bought the camera, remote control, larger bag, I did have to buy and AC Adapter and an extra battery.

Cons....The USB Cable is too short and the camera and EOS Utility are far too sensitive to cable length......a longer cable is definitely needed. One battery is insufficient, after about 200 photos the battery is dead, the additional battery was cheap plus the AC Adapter was cheap.......What was Canon thinking by not including these with the camera?????"
2753189,12473471,4,True,B00N462AQE,I purchased this as a graduation gift.  The bundle was a good value but there seems to be a problem with the external flash unit not fitting the  hot shoe on camera body. I am trying to exhcange it and hoping for good outcome.  The camera itself is great so far.
2753190,12473472,5,False,B00N462AQE,Very pleased..delivered promptly..this was a gift for my son. Everything came in as advertised. Awesome products great delivery!!! My sn was ecstatic over this bundle!
2753191,12473473,4,True,B00N462AQE,Great kit for the price.
2753192,12473474,5,True,B00N462AQE,Bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.  Everything fits/works.  A great bargin when you consider all that was included.  I would highly recommend this for someone looking to get into digital photography!
2753193,12473475,4,True,B00N462AQE,"EXCELLENT CAMERA BRAND NEW , THE 18-55 AND 70-300 ARE CANON LENSES, THE TRIPOD IS A TOY TRIPOD, NOT GOOD QUALITY, THE TELEPHOTO AND MACRO GOOD QUALITY,THE FILTERS ARE GOOD QUALITY. THE BAG ITS VERY SIMPLE, THE FLASH ITS SIMPLE, THE MEMORIES THAT BOLTONS SENDS ISNT TRANSCEND, ARE GENERIC BRANDED, (ACCESORIES ARE ""BIG FOOT"" BRAND"","
2753194,12473476,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great customer service. Immediately fixed an issue I had with my tripod.
2753195,12473477,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Love the camera but the stuff that came in the ""package deal"" was crap."
2753196,12473478,3,True,B00N462AQE,"The camera has been fantastic! Takes excellent quality photos and videos.  Upon arrival of the package I knew right away there were many accessories I would not be using. The tripod is cheaply made but it does serve its purpose for still photos. If you are wanting a tripod for video, invest in a better tripod. One of the accessories I was looking forward to using was the filters. However, they were not in the box.. Not a huge deal but was a contributing factor to my 3 star rating.  The last issue I have been having is with the 32GB SD card.  I used it to shoot a large amount of video. The video could be viewed on the camera but as soon as I pull the SD card and put into a computer or other device I am prompted that the SD card needs to be formatted to be used. I'm a little tech savvy so I was able to recover the files using some data recovery software but, this is an additional step that I should not have to take. The 8GB SD card works well and other 32GB SD cards I have purchased work well. It seems to be an issue with that particular card.

To end on a positive..  The case that came in this bundle is just right for me.  It is not possible to fit all the accessories in it but it does a nice job of holding my camera with the kit lense and an additional lense. The front pocket is suitable for the battery and some small miscellaneous items. I use one of the side pockets to hold my SD card carrying case and the other side pocket to hold my lense cloth.

The camera is easily a 5 star purchase.  The accessories were all decent enough to use with the exception of the 32GB SD card and the missing filters."
2753197,12473479,5,True,B00N462AQE,Love it!!
2753198,12473480,5,True,B00N462AQE,this camera gives me soo much life. its gives my pictures professional quality and it is easy to use. the items in the bundle are all very useful. some I really don't know how to use yet but this is really worth the money.
2753199,12473481,5,True,B00N462AQE,Awesome camera! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a camera to buy this!
2753200,12473482,1,True,B00N462AQE,except camera and a tripod other Stuff like lense do not fit in it ... not a good option to buy.. they are making money.
2753201,12473483,2,True,B00N462AQE,"Camera and 18-135mm len are great. However, 4filters, angle len and the telephoto len are all for 58mm (for example, compatible for 18-55mm len), not for 67mm(18-135mm len). Looking for replacing the mistaken items. Thanks"
2753202,12473484,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Everything was great, except the tripod extra was really cheap material and broke on only the second use.  Still an excellent value for the package."
2753203,12473485,5,True,B00N462AQE,Canon Bundle has great tools to start. Excellent Value
2753204,12473486,5,True,B00N462AQE,Came with everything promised and fast shipping. Highly satisfied with my purchase!
2753205,12473487,5,True,B00N462AQE,GREAT
2753206,12473488,5,True,B00N462AQE,Totally enjoying it.. more in the package then expected!!
2753207,12473489,4,True,B00N462AQE,"I was happy with the accessories, in general.  But I was expecting a more robust tripod that could safely hold my camera with the telephoto lens attached."
2753208,12473490,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Fast shipping, everything was as described."
2753209,12473491,3,True,B00N462AQE,"I received my Cannon Rebel camera two days after ordering. It was the offer from Ritz Camera. Since I am a novice to the camera world I confided in a friend and he said the camera was a very good camera and since the offer was from Ritz everything should be good.
After opening the box I find that the wide angle lens are not Cannon lens but an off brand lens. The flash dos not fit on the camera and is an off brand also, useless.  I thought these parts should have been Cannon products. When you see the dsplay, you see the Cannon name on the camera and one lens with Cannon stamped on the side which makes you believe the bundle is all Cannon products. I feel this was misleading."
2753210,12473492,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I received every single item in this package. I haven't used everything in the package yet, but so far I am loving this camera. I can't wait to play around with all the different features."
2753211,12473493,5,True,B00N462AQE,camera broke after six pics so hard to rate it. I have returned it and plan to reorder the same one as I believe it is a very good product
2753212,12473494,5,True,B00N462AQE,The product is good
2753213,12473495,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Great product so far. The only thing I'll knock a star down is that I wish this set came with was a step down ring to 58MM which is needed in order to use the telephoto lens and the macro lens. You will have to purchase this separately. Also, the larger tri-pod is a bit weak. One of the legs popped out of it's main connector, which I'll have to figure something out to fix it. The bag is great, and holds pretty much everything included aside from the larger tripod."
2753214,12473496,5,True,B00N462AQE,Excellent product great service
2753215,12473497,4,True,B00N462AQE,"I love the camera and most of the accessories. The bundle came with the wrong filters, though, which is why I took off one star. I thought I could trust the Ritz Camera name to fulfill my order properly, but they have let me down. I received macro filters rather than the standard ones listed in the product details. The filters were one major reason I picked this particular bundle, so I wouldn't have to go buy a UV filter separately to put on my lens right away. The wide angle lens happens to be one of my favorite parts of this kit."
2753216,12473498,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Love my camera,  it's perfect.  As for the accessories, they are s
 cheap and  the website stated true canon accessories which they are not but overall still happy with the camera. Shipping was fast"
2753217,12473499,5,True,B00N462AQE,"My camera arrived well packaged, the product is as described and so far I am loving getting to know all the options available to me."
2753218,12473500,5,True,B00N462AQE,This camera package was a great value.  I purchased the fir my daughter and she absolutely love it!
2753219,12473501,5,True,B00N462AQE,I'm in love with my T5i. The set did come with everything pictured. The quality of the pictures are amazing. This is the easiest camera to operate on Manual mode ever designed.
2753220,12473502,4,True,B00N462AQE,"I got this in the black friday. It is a great deal. However, the flash is not compatible. Also, they send it with only one memory not like what they put in the description"
2753221,12473503,2,True,B00N462AQE,"If I purchased a Canon product (which is NOT cheap), why send subpar accessories to go with?  The remote is a total flop, it does not work. I am still wondering why the remote is NOT a Canon brand. The tripod is also flimsy.  I had  better product selection when I ordered a Nikon bundle.  I am disappointed, I expected more quality."
2753222,12473504,5,True,B00N462AQE,Love the quality.
2753223,12473505,5,True,B00N462AQE,everything I expected
2753224,12473506,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Love the camera really good deal for what you get... everything in package is pretty good if Ur a casual enthusiast to semi professional... The 57"" tripod Can be used but is very flimsy and cheapish so be gentle is not for hardcore use. The table tripod don't even think about it, it can't hold the weight of the camera even worse with the lens. One of the Marco lens attachments doesnt fit but i don't U'll end up using them anyway. Overall a totally great deal."
2753225,12473507,4,True,B00N462AQE,"The camera is awesome, but the flash I don't like  it, and the rest of the components are aceptable and my package was 3 days outside in my front front door..that's bad because I was traveling and the package comes earlier than expected.  But thanks"
2753226,12473508,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great camera.  Got it quick.  Great package of items to go with Camera.
2753227,12473509,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Love the camera. Came quickly and was packaged well. Only thing I was hoping there was an extended warranty that could be purchased,  but other than that, great product and would order from Ritz again!!"
2753228,12473510,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Ok, even after reading other reviews I went ahead an ordered this ""kit"" as I felt the price was worth the camera alone.  It arrived in a reasonable amount of time for UPS, which is just above lame mule. If you ever want something in a timely manner I would consider Amazon Prime.  I am seriously thinking about it.  Over a week to get here is silly.  Ok, on to the kit.  Camera speaks for itself and has been reviewed to death here and other places on line so that's a no brainer. It's great.  The lenses are stock and there are better quality Canon lenses out there and I happen to have one or two so these are just extras to me.

Many complain about the ""case""?  I don't know if they have changed the case or what, but  I received a very nice Vivitar case.  Heavy duty and large enough for the camera and a couple of lenses.  Which is all I need.  I am the casual photog and don't take 15 lenses and a bunch of ""extras"".  If you
do that, then the case will be too small for you. I like it and will use it. The rest of the stuff is standard.  Vivitar lenses are medium grade and work nicely for the average Joe photog. I don't do a lot of special pictures, but do a lot of close up stuff and for that I have other lenses.  The tripod is junk and the rest of the stuff too, but hey, just consider it free.  Give it away as gifts to people you don't like.  The extra flash unit is redundant as the cameras own flash is more than adequate.  The remote is nice, but remember you will need to be pointed at the front of the camera for it to work properly.  I prefer a corded remote, but that's me.  The added memory chips are a nice touch and will be used.

That's about all I can tell you about this particular set up.  Great value, but there is a lot of useless things that come with it.  You won't be disappointed."
2753229,12473511,4,True,B00N462AQE,Daughter using it for college classes.  No issues with camera
2753230,12473512,4,False,B00N462AQE,"THANK YOU RITZ CAMERA!!!  I got this bundle for a Christmas present from my husband and son and was disappointed when I didn't get what was actually advertized in the bundle.  My husband contacted Ritz and was told that the items in question were not in stock at the time and offered a full refund.  I said I LOVED the camera and didn't want to send it back but wanted the items that were supposed to come with it.  He was told that as soon as the items were restocked, which could take several weeks, they would send them.  I agreed with that and on March 10, 2015 I got my Polaroid four filter set along with the Polaroid slave flash and the Polaroid Studio Series .43 mm wide angle lens, I got the .45 mm lens by another manufacturer.  I may have had to wait but now have what my husband and son paid for and in the end I am very satisfied!  Even though I should have gotten what the bundle contained in the first place I appreciate you getting items to me as soon as you did."
2753231,12473513,5,False,B00N462AQE,"I'm just now making my foray into photography; my girlfriend knew that I was looking for my own camera (been borrowing a D3300 from a buddy) and surprised me with this kit for our anniversary.

The T5i needs no introduction;  it was brand-new as advertised and is everything I thought it would be.

Now that I'm reading other reviews about the accessories, I'm glad that I didn't place the order myself, as there seem to have been problems a few months ago. I've used all of them and honestly haven't had any issues. I really like the camera bag and the memory cards are a huge bonus these days, what with all of the gadgets I have that need one. I'll take free memory cards wherever I can get them. I'm not too experimental with filters and macros, so that isn't a huge deal for me, but they all seem to be good quality.

The tripod is solid for what I need; I wouldn't go buck-wild with it, but I took some great outdoor shots with it earlier. My girlfriend is making her own customized RitzPix photo book as I write this, so even she's happy with her gift that she got for me!

All in all a perfect kit and transaction!

My girlfriend says that delivery was very fast even though she selected standard."
2753232,12473514,1,True,B00N462AQE,"Fantastic camera, this thing is amazing. But putting all that aside I should have went with the reviews. Just like a previous customer on here I was also stuck with a bunch of low dollar generic add ons that were nothing they advertised. I guess for somebody that doesn't know what there looking for it would be ""ok"" but for anybody that does research or has some knowledge will know they got stuck with a bunch of crap parts. I would recommend this camera allllll day long but absolutely do not order off here it's just going to cause stress and disappointment."
2753233,12473515,1,True,B00N462AQE,"Awesome Camera by Canon...... Great DSLR - Camera I rate 4.5 Stars.

0 Star for the rest!
BUT,.... everything that came in the bundled ""CrapOlah""
The large Tripod where the screw on the top supposedly attached the camera to it was bent!!! Unusable!
Mini Tripod is a joke, beware, it could damage your camera, it tips over.... Tripods were made with soft aluminum material, might as well be made of soft clay.......... bad bad, not to mention all the lens, flash, etc..... CrapOlah!"
2753234,12473516,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Great package, everything has worked well and I have not had any problems.  Only thing I could say that's negative is that the 2 tripods are kinda crappy, but at least the bigger one is usable if you don't already have a tripod.  I don't know if I would use the smaller one, with a camera of this size and weight I just wouldn't trust something so small to hold it.  A web cam maybe but not my t5i."
2753235,12473517,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Before I start, I appreciated everything.  Everything works with the camera.  I understand not getting the brand, but some of the stuff I got was really flimsy. The tripod I will never use before it doesn't look like it can even hold the t5i and the camera. Yikes.  Luckily I have both of the things from before.  If you are from a cold place buying this camera.... The solution bottles will explode.  Just saying."
2753236,12473518,4,True,B00N462AQE,"I need to complain that the lens kit we ordered is 18-135mm which requires a 67mm thread for filters and lens attachments, but the filters and lens attachments they included in our box are 58mm attachments.
- 4pc HD Macro Close Up Filter Set  is designed for 58mm
- Vivitar 58mm Telephoto Lens, uses 62mm filters
- Vivitar 58mm Wide Angle Lens, uses 62mm filters"
2753237,12473519,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Love my camera! Only thing I wish it had was built in wifi. Still, the camera is incredible for my uses and it has been a great camera for me to learn with. Enjoy every time I take it out of the bag."
2753238,12473520,5,True,B00N462AQE,i was very excited when I got my package in the mail but from the reviews I was worried they were going to give me some knock off products instead of the ones listed. That wasn't the case at all! Everything came as promised and the camera takes amazing pictures. The only down side is that the tripods aren't that great at supporting the cameras weight. Other than that I'm a very happy customer.
2753239,12473521,5,True,B00N462AQE,This camera is a US model.  And I know that many are bashing this package because the extras are cheap.  All I can say is- really? then go somewhere else pay $750 and get nothing extra.  I actually am surprised how much I have used all the extras.
2753240,12473522,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I love it.
Everything I was hoping for."
2753241,12473523,5,True,B00N462AQE,Extremely fast delivery. Product is superbly
2753242,12473524,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Great packing, bought it mainly for the camera and lens, rest all the accessories were freebies. not ll the accessories are of good quality but as i said they are freebies and it doesn't matter."
2753243,12473525,5,True,B00N462AQE,Amazing!
2753244,12473526,5,True,B00N462AQE,Love this! Need to relearn using a digital slr.  Everything came as described
2753245,12473527,4,True,B00N462AQE,Good value for most of the items in the bundle....the lenses are fair but the flash that it came with doesn't even fit the camera.
2753246,12473528,4,True,B00N462AQE,Great camera package for the price. The tripod is too flimsy
2753247,12473529,5,True,B00N462AQE,Cannot beat the price
2753248,12473530,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great deal
2753249,12473531,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I expected the possibility of low budget equipment but it does the job. I was happy for my camera and lenses at the price, everything else was just freebies to me. Thank for the carrying bag, filters and everything else I received  :)"
2753250,12473532,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great camera and lens package. Takes awesome photos and came with everything listed. It was a huge savings to buy as a bundle.
2753251,12473533,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Good VALUE!!  I have wanted this camera for awhile, and with the help of amazon, got no interest for 12 months!  I love this camera!  I received this later than the expected delivery date, but it was FedEx's fault, not yours!  The only thing that mislead me was that you only receive one lens, (besides the telephoto and wide angle) The picture makes it look like you get one on the camera and another lens as well. Little did I know that you could pay $50 more and get an extra lens...little frustrating and will be contacting Ritz.  Also, as with other people that had bought this set, I also received knock off items that are said to be compatible but haven't tried them yet...we shall see..."
2753252,12473534,5,True,B00N462AQE,i love it
2753253,12473535,5,True,B00N462AQE,"The best deal ever ! Been using it all,friends want this now."
2753254,12473536,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Very good price for the package. The camera was for my daughter's Christmas present. So far she is very happy with it. She also has a Nikon, but she prefers this Canon for her assignments."
2753255,12473537,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great camera with a great package.  Camera fits the needs of a beginner as well as an experienced photographer.
2753256,12473538,4,True,B00N462AQE,Received items order a reasonable amount of time. Many of the items are knock offs however overall it is still a very good value.
2753257,12473539,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Fantastic camera.  I started out looking for a 25X zoom camera since my son had just bought one.  I read all the reviews and noticed that everyone had the same problem with it, shutter shock makes the picture blurred. Then I took a look at Nikon and their version.  I also looked at the upper end camera's around $350 for the body.  By the time you add the lenses and the flash, the remote etc. I wound up with a $1,200 set.  Since I didn't have that kind of money, I fell back to the Rebel T5i.  It's better than Nikons offer and I've owned a Rebel before.
Whether your an beginner or serious amateur you will find this camera is great for all your needs.  If used correctly, your pictures will look as good as a pro. Just shoot and enjoy."
2753258,12473540,1,True,B00N462AQE,I would love to give the camera a high rating. The camera it's self takes great pictures and videos I think. However the extra $400 +/- I spent on the package was a total waste of money. It was advertised to come with 2 extra lenses. That is the only reason I ordered it with the package. The lenses that came with it don't even fit on the camera and they were not the brand that was advertised. The larger tripod is wobbly and made so cheaply I think I could bend the metal legs with my bare hands. The plastic joints are flimsy and I suspect they will break in no time. Totally cheap. Another item included was a package of clear plastic stick on lens protector sheets. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with those. I sure don't want to put them on the camera lens and the owners manual states you should not put one on touch screen. The rest of the stuff looked like it might have come out of a cereal box. There was a stick on elastic thing that was supposed to hold the lens cover to the camera that fell off every time I took off the else cover. It was a total and complete rip off.  When I contacted Ritz camera they offered to give me $30 for the 2 lenses or I could return the entire package. I guess the $30 is generous considering one of the same lens sells for $6.99 here on Amazon. I used the camera and read the book before I realized the extra lenses didn't fit so I'm afraid if I send it back they won't refund me my full price. I wish I had known that I could of bought the camera direct from Cannon for hundreds of dollars less. I have been ordering through Amazon for years and this is the first time I have felt ripped off. Stay away from the package deals and especially Ritz camera.
2753259,12473541,1,True,B00N462AQE,"Camera constantly says BUSY, almost all items are knock offs, don't fit properly... Was missing a lot of items... they were not a good company to work for"
2753260,12473542,4,True,B00N462AQE,Excelent cam... Excelent seller
2753261,12473543,5,False,B00N462AQE,it is just what i wanted. Thank you.
2753262,12473544,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I am extremely happy with this package!  After reading other reviews I was a bit worried, but for the price this was an amazing deal.  All items were as listed and delivered quickly!  I can't wait to figure out the camera to get some serious use out of it!!"
2753263,12473545,5,True,B00N462AQE,"All items that are described came in the package. Nothing was forgotten. If there was anything forgotten, the seller would be more than accommodating to make sure you have everything that is listed. This is my first SLR camera, so I really have nothing to compare it to, except a point and shoot digital camera. I know, that is like comparing apples to oranges. :) I am 100% satisfied with the camera. It takes excellent pictures. The additional items that come with it are a great plus. I use the UV filter lens as a protective lens for whichever lens I am using. Since the filter lens are stack-able, you can put the polarized lens on top of the UV lens, and get great outdoor pics. No more glare and super sharp images. I have not had the chance to use the fluorescent lens.

The manual setting for the camera has lots of option for you to get that perfect capture. The preset settings are also super great. I am very impressed on how user friendly this camera is. each item that is adjustable in any setting, has a little description on the display screen, when you touch the setting that you want to adjust. This lets you know what you are adjusting, and what kind of effects it will have.

I have also used the Vivitar wide angel lens and the Vivitar 2.2x telephoto lens. I have attached them to the 18-55mm lens. The 2.2x telephoto lens is great for those up-close portfolio pics that you want to get without having to use the 75-300mm lens.

Again this is coming from a person who has purchased their very first SLR camera, and really knew nothing of the complexity of the camera. To be honest, I thought it would be too overwhelming to operate, and I would have to just rely on the pre-settings. This is not true. I have done a lot adjustments on the manual setting, and the other settings that allow you to do a lot of adjustments. All it took was trial and error to get some great pics.

I got the camera in time for Christmas. I took a lot of pics on Christmas eve, and Christmas day. More than I would have ever imagined :)

If you are upgrading to a SLR camera, or first time buying a SLR camera, I highly recommend to purchase this camera."
2753264,12473546,2,True,B00N462AQE,Worst package ever. Everything that come in it is all cheap quality and is not what it said in the description. The camera was good but stopped working. The slave flash was not even working. I emailed them but they said they will not send anything but they will refund $35.00. Other problem it is same as t4i. I am now going to get 70d.
2753265,12473547,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I absolutely love it.  The package is awesome, has everything i could ever want.  Camera takes the best pics. Quick Shipping"
2753266,12473548,5,True,B00N462AQE,Best value on canon t5i.  Delivered as scheduled.  Very satisfied with results.
2753267,12473549,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I am so pleased with my purchase of this camera! The main reason I bought this package deal was not because of the amount of stuff in the package, but that this package with the camera included ($698) was cheaper than just buying the camera alone ($700)

Making this deal just awesome! Yeah there might not be the best quality things in the deal, however there are a few things tucked away in there that are great!  This package is definitely worth the money! The camera is fantastic as well! No problems at all about it."
2753268,12473550,5,True,B00N462AQE,Love this camera.  We have another Canon and it is so nice for my husband and I both to get out and shoot great shots.  :)  Easy to use and set up.
2753269,12473551,5,True,B00N462AQE,I absolutely love my new camera. This was a great package deal.
2753270,12473552,4,True,B00N462AQE,The camera and the memory cards were good.  Everything else was useless or very poor quality. The filters did not match the lens that I purchased.  The store did give me $30 credit after I wrote to ask for replacement to lenses that matched with my camera lens.
2753271,12473553,1,True,B00N462AQE,"When I purchased the items showed were all Polaroid items in description and in the photo. but when I received it they are all some brand I don't recognize. I would have purchased from some other dealer if I wanted generic extra lenses and parts. The flash even doesn't fit in the camera. The stock photo changed all of a sudden , now the don't show brand anymore.
NOTE: Will update based on response."

2753274,12473556,1,True,B00N462AQE,Camara is great accesories are different from advertized. Ritz Camara customer service is crap. In all camas is good but this Ritz Camara people are scamers.
2753275,12473557,5,True,B00N462AQE,GREAT for any level of experience. Very easy to navigate. Touchscreen makes all the difference.

3757410,18502968,5,True,B0058GI38W,Fantastic camera at twice the price. Mine was refurbished and I am fine with that as the price was almost half a non-refurb. The camera arrived in perfect condition without a scratch or blemish anywhere. I purchased this to replace another E-PL3 that I dropped in a lake. The camera takes great pictures and has plenty of shooting modes and editing modes in camera. I still have other lenses and a bigger flash from my last camera and the E-PL3 couple with a couple of lenses and a good flash will let one take pictures in under any conditions.
3807462,18801403,1,True,B008CMVDK4,Great little camera but I should have bought a new one. This one has lint or something inside the camera and it shows on all my pictures with a lighter background.  I did not notice it until many months after the purchase because I had not taken any pics of the sky.
3866450,19092668,3,False,B00CAPQ2GY,"The device is OK except for one real problem. If there is a power and internet failure, the device can go
 ""offline"" and can only be restarted locally.
If you are not local , the device cannot be restarted and is worthless."

Thanks"
3893717,19214745,5,True,B00DY9XD7Q,We use it all the time!  Very few pix seem dark.  Probably my fault.
3913122,19299985,5,True,B00DWHVJPI,"I love the camera body, shoots beautiful shots. Not a fan of the large zoom lens needing the connector. The rest of the kit is excellent."
4006363,19651528,4,True,B00K3PNBXK,"The SL25 camera operates as expected.  I had no difficulty connecting the camera to my older Samsung Note 2, my wife's Note 4, or my sons's Acer tablet.  Both phones connect easily via NFC and the tablet via wifi.
Pictures quality is reasonable and zoom works well.  You will definitely need a tripod or something to stabilize it at high zoom settings.  Video also works fine.  It's a snap to view images and share them through your phone.

Probably the one drawback is the speed of setting things up when you want to take a picture.  This isn't a camera you pick up and start snapping pics with 5 seconds later.  Connecting a device,  getting it paired, and taking photos can take anywhere between 30-60 seconds,  so plan accordingly.

The size is very convenient.  Taking this to our kids sporting events or school functions is easier than taking our DSLR.  My wife loves it!"
4006364,19651529,1,True,B00K3PNBXK,I won't even give it one star...Not compatible with a Samsung 6 and won't let me return...
4006365,19651530,1,True,B00K3PNBXK,"What a shame!  This lens camera is beautiful.  Well built and sexy.  I rigged it to my Galaxy Note 3 and it was awesome.  But then came the connectivity nightmare.  You're supposed to select the lens Wi-Fi signal to your phone.  Ok, Did that.  Then you have to run the PIXPRO application.  Did that.  And then it connects and three seconds later you get an error saying that it cannot connect, EVEN THOUGH your phone's wi-fi is still connected to the lens.  I looked at the app and it is version 1. something.  Piece of junk.  I have another Kodak camera and it is supposed to work with the same application and I had the same problem.  The issue is that there is no other software for android.  Don't know if it works better with the iPhone.  Didn't test it.  But I highly would discourage anyone from buying this because you WILL be disappointed.  How can you use a camera when you have a subject and the darn thing disconnects from your phone and you miss the shot?  Shame on PIXPRO and their developers for doing such a lousy job with the software that is so critical for the lens to work.  I would give it half a star if I could.  Worthless."
4006366,19651531,1,True,B00K3PNBXK,"Really wish this thing would work.  I cannot get it to sync with my iPhone.  I was going to return it, but was two days past the 30 day policy."
4006367,19651532,1,True,B00K3PNBXK,"In general I like it. I've only taken a few photos so far, but they are very satisfactory so far. I will update this part of the topic after I get more experience using it. The only negative I've noted is that it can be a little awkward  to hold the combination of lens and phone. Apple's moving the power button to the side of iPhone 6 contributes to this. I have accidentally turned the iPhone off when trying to take a shot. However, I think I have found a solution to this issue. I am using a small handle that has a 1/4 20 screw (tripod thread) at the end of it to help with handling the combination of iPhone and lens. So far, it works quite well. There are many types of these handles available on amazon. I also find that I prefer using the shutter button on the lens itself rather than tripping the shutter button using the iPhone App. There is a noticeable lag when taking a picture from the App.

July 2015, I recently used the lens to take some landscape photos. This is the first time I have used the lens outdoors. I am very satisfied with the results. both telephoto and wide angle shots were taken. I am satisfied with the results that I received. At the longest telephoto setting I was able to handhold the shot. I intend to magnify some of these shots to see if they are sharp enough to print them. I will post those results later.

At the moment this is an expensive paperweight. The PixPro App,which is required to use the lens with an iPhone does not work with IOS 9. Until Kodak corrects this issue, I recommend that you do not buy this unit.

It is now November and the PixPro app still does not provide camera  controls. This greatly limits the functionality of the lens. I've queried Kodak for an expected time frame for a revision to the software that will again provide the controls it originally had. Kodak has not yet replied. If there was a way I could return my lens, I would. It is definitely not the unit that I paid for. I would have been better off with one of the other units that are available."

4135112,20066270,5,True,B00SBY097G,"Great lite weight camera with the 18-55mm lens which is quick & sharp. One of the best features is the touch screen which is fast easy to use. The 70-300mm interfaces well with the DSLR. Camera works great high speed shutter mode and continuous focusing mode. Find the range wireless remote ok not great. Tripod has great features but made of plastic will not trust my DSLR on it. USB 2.0 reader works well . WIFI easy to work with Iphone app, able to take pictures with Nikon WMU app very easily. The D5500 and kit lens are well is worth the money. I did not buy this camera for the accessories some are better that others."

4203232,20453862,5,True,B014RQ4F0S,I was very happy to find this camera for such a low price to replace an older model that can no longer be repaired. So far it works well. The camera was delivered early but the USPS box was damaged (it does not seem to have affected the camera).

6009760,12473390,4,True,B00N462AQE,"All in all this is a pretty nice package for the money.  The tripod is a little cheesy, but I did not expect anything more.  The IR wireless shutter release did not work.  Ritz Camera was not interested in resolving this issue and referred me to Amazon.  Amazon sent a replacement.  Great customer service from Amazon."
6009761,12473391,5,True,B00N462AQE,Very good kit.
6009762,12473392,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great package for someone just starting out.  I love the camera and all the extra add-ons have been super helpful.  The only thing that didn't work was the SD card reader.  I had to toss it because it kept corrupting my files.  I didn't buy this package for the card reader though so I wasn't really upset.
6009763,12473393,5,True,B00N462AQE,worked great
6009764,12473394,4,True,B00N462AQE,"The package contained one battery and charger, which weren't mentioned in ad but I'm happy that they were included.  The Rebel T5i camera has a touch screen with instructions not to cover with a screen protector.  However, before reading the instructions I had attached one of the screen protectors, which were included in the package but shouldn't have been included with this camera.  I haven't had time to become acquainted with all the features of the camera but believe for the price it will suit my purpose."

6009771,12473401,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I bought this gift as a graduation present to myself, and to say that I am pleased is a bit of an understatement. Coming from the camera of my iPhone 6, I was blown away by the quality of this camera. Pictures are clear and the kit lens is fantastic as well. As for the other items, everything came as advertised and I am very happy with the package. One item, the slave flash, was dysfunctional upon arrival, but a quick email to Ritz Camera was all that was needed as they replaced the item for free. The tripod is very lightweight and portable, but a bit stiff at times. The remote control is a real life-saver in those instances in which you cannot be behind the camera. For the money, this is a great package. Definitely Recommend!"
6009772,12473402,5,True,B00N462AQE,Good
6009773,12473403,3,True,B00N462AQE,still learning all the gadgets on this thing the lenses was very tight on the wide angle so we had to figure that out you get polaroid with canon pieces because they were so screwed tightly together lenses were all over we hope we have it back together right aint sure but like I say we still playing with it
6009774,12473404,2,True,B00N462AQE,"It seems like the camera I got doesn't have a proper functioning sensor. All the videos I take come out with a lot of ""noise"" and grain no matter how low I set my ISO or how much light I use. Pretty frustrating."

6009778,12473408,5,True,B00N462AQE,Wife loved it takes great photos
6009779,12473409,4,True,B00N462AQE,"While I was highly disappointed with the shipping time.  Being a prime member and no other choice than free 2 day shipping. I expected it to arrive May 8th or 9th since I ordered it on the morning of the 6th. Not May 12th. Definitely an area for improvement on both Amazon and the sellers part. Don't set customers expectations and then fail to meet those expectations. Makes a customer leary to make such an expensive purchase. Let alone recommend it to friends.
  However, other than that snafu,  this is an amazing bundle at a great price. Most of my friends that own camera's like this are extremely jealous as they've paid a lot more and have a lot less. The only complaint about anything in this bundle is the camera bag, it's a little  small for all of this equipment. The next size up bag would be perfect for storing everything in this bundle."
6009780,12473410,1,True,B00N462AQE,My lens came damaged it was impossible to contact Ritzcamera.com to get assistance. I had to reach out to Canon to provide assistance with getting a replacement lens.  I will definitely consider that before making my next purchase.

6009784,12473414,5,True,B00N462AQE,This was purchased as a birthday gift for a budding amateur photographer.  She couldn't be happier with it.  Everything that came in the package was exactly what was described and shown in the product photo.  Just be aware that the tripod is pretty light weight and probably not well suited for the value of this camera body and kit lens.  You might want to consider purchasing a better one in addition to this package.

6009796,12473426,5,True,B00N462AQE,Nice
6009797,12473427,4,True,B00N462AQE,"Still learning how to best use it. However, I'm enjoying it."
6009798,12473428,4,True,B00N462AQE,"I am obsessed with my new camera! Im not so tech savvy so I don't really know about the other products. However, the tripod was very weak and unstable. Love my new rebel canon t5i, great investment"
6009799,12473429,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Delivery was within reason.  All accessories came as advertised.  So far, I am pleased with the camera although I haven't had a lot of time to play with it."
6009800,12473430,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great.
6009801,12473431,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Impressed! Arrived earlier than expected, packaging was superb- Thank you-"
6009802,12473432,5,True,B00N462AQE,"My only regret was not buying the T6i for the extra $200. However, this camera and kit is more than perfect for the amount and type of photography I use it for."
6009803,12473433,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great camera for anyone
6009804,12473434,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great package.  We looked around and this was the best deal with all the extra's.
6009805,12473435,5,True,B00N462AQE,Everything worked accordingly and everything was included!
6009806,12473436,5,True,B00N462AQE,Thrilled with the value of this purchase!  Looked at a lot of outfits on Amazon and happy I chose this one. You won't be diassapointed!
6009807,12473437,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great camera...great set of accessories.
6009808,12473438,5,True,B00N462AQE,Great deal love it.
6009809,12473439,5,True,B00N462AQE,It was everything my daughter wanted and more!
6009810,12473440,5,True,B00N462AQE,Wonderful camera.  Purchased as Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves it.  Says it's easy to use and for a new photography student she really is enjoy it.  Service was fast and quick.  Appreciate it and would order from them again.
6009811,12473441,5,True,B00N462AQE,"I've been wanting a Rebel T5i for some time now but I was a bit hesitant to place this order as a lot of the feedback was saying that the items received were different than the description. I am glad I took the chance on this. Everything was as described or better! First off, all the products in the kit were the correct brand (Polaroid, Canon, Ritz Gear, and Transcend). The camera body and Canon lens are perfect. I checked out the Polaroid telephoto and macro lenses and they screwed onto the Canon lens without need for any adapter. The filters were all packaged nicely and totally clear. The bag is not bad at all and holds all the equipment I plan to bring with me. The best surprise was the tripod. I knew it would be a relatively flimsy aluminum frame but it came with leveling bubbles, a pan/tilt handle, a carry bag, and a grip to easily move the tripod around. If you are looking for a ""get out there and shoot"" kit, this is the one for you!"
6009812,12473442,5,True,B00N462AQE,Was what I was hoping it would be and more. Great bundle of equipment
6009813,12473443,4,True,B00N462AQE,"The camera works perfectly and all the  accessories that come with the package are great, except for the table top try pod it falls over when you attach the camera to it. The camera with the lens on it causes it to fall forward. I would recommend this camera kit to anyone looking for a great camera kit."
6009814,12473444,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Excellent camera. One of top 4 recommended by a consumer reporting magazine and 2 of the other 4 were $3000.
Taken about 2000 photos so far.
Lots of features. Plenty of range for everyone from beginner to pro."
6009815,12473445,4,True,B00N462AQE,"I purchased my order from Ritz Camera. It came with all of the products (and brands!) listed above (except I received a 32GB and 16GB Transcend SD card instead of a 32GB and 8GB, but I'm not complaining) Generally, I am content with my purchase. The camera and kit lens are great. I haven't found anything wrong with them. However, there are a few things that I am frustrated with.

The Polaroid Studio Series .43X HD Wide Angle Lens and Polaroid 2.2X HD Telephoto Lens are basically a joke. They do not fit on my camera or kit lens no matter what I try. They seem to be too small, and there were no directions on how to use them properly. Another thing I am unhappy with is the fact that the larger Polaroid tripod was defected when I received it, but the seller does not provide a way to contact them about defects and exchanges. The smaller tripod is unable to hold the weight of the camera because it is only meant for small point and shoots and webcams. For all intents and purposes, I am left without a tripod. The camera bag is a little small too, so I'd suggest purchasing a larger bag if you're serious about photography or plan to travel with all of the accessories.

What I do like about this purchase is the obvious price point. It's a much better deal than just purchasing only the camera body and kit lens. The 4 lens filters, SD cards, external flash, wireless remote, lens cleaning kit, SD card reader, memory card wallet, EF-S 18-55mm lens, and camera itself make this purchase worth it in my opinion. Especially if you're looking to get into photography. It's great having all of these accessories.

Also, for those of you who have been asking, the kit lens is made by Canon."
6009816,12473446,1,True,B00N462AQE,"Even though the product details clearly state Polaroid brand , mine showed up with dirt cheap knock off brand
Some of the accessories don't fit the camera like the flesh
Tripod is not good quality"
7975479,18077272,5,True,B001K7ZW96,I love this camera! Love it so much my wife bought me a T5 for christmas last year!
8044979,18643911,4,True,B006A1NWZI,"Okay lets start with I know nothing about cameras but being an amateur photographer I bought this for fun. This is my first dslr for that matter but it wasn't that hard to use at all. After months of using it I started to use it less and less for photos and more and more for video. This camera is very reliable and hasn't given me any issues. Here is my overall stance on it.
Pros:
- reliable
- easy to use
Cons:
- with any dslr (bulky)
- video recording doesn't have continuous focus"

8218023,19612220,5,True,B00JIXDY5I,Nice package of materials.
8226986,19651526,4,True,B00K3PNBXK,"I read a lot of reviews regarding connectivity issues. But it is not the hardware. It is a question of understanding the networking.  The camera tries to connect to all the networks available. Hence it is required to select the right hardware to connect to. This camera will not replace a decent SLR camera.  However, one could carry this in the jacket pocket and take some decent pictures. I find it useful as I travel a bit and this one is extremely handy to carry around and the picture quality is pretry good compared to the phone camera. The zoom feature is quite nice too. A tripod is necessary for good results at  full zoom."
8226987,19651527,3,True,B00K3PNBXK,"Pro:
A big step up from a cellphone camera, Images are incredibly sharp in comparison
25x optical zoom lets me get good close cropped shots of birds in my backyard.
Leaving the camera on constantly works fine for me. no overheating seen.

Con:
No manual focus. The camera seems to ignore where you tell it to focus (touch to focus) more often than not. an option to manually focus in the software would be a great help.
Shutter lag.
burst shots are not nearly as sharp as shots made in (P) mode.
burst mode also refocuses from what you were looking at when you hit the button.
SDHC only.
zoom control is slow. this is software side stuff. we need a way to select, with a touch, a quick zoom amount. not a plus or minus button that makes you wait between each small step before you can zoom further. Another option would be a slider that only zooms once you let go of the slider, then you can choose a percentage of zoom and let the camera go straight to that zoom amount."
8231762,19673035,5,True,B00KCXFHQW,Complete package...my wife love it!
8242726,19718467,5,True,B00L0XMR8E,Great camera for the price.  The optical zoom is awesome!
8242727,19718468,4,True,B00L0XMR8E,"I have had several of these Canon SX-510 cameras already. Here is my review on this camera.
Goods: 30X optical zoom, manual modes, program modes, scene modes, good continuous shooting, decent battery life, easy to navigate menu, uses SD or SDHC cards, it has wifi for those that use it [which I don't use], decent photo and video qualities.
Bads: Sometimes very slow to focus, takes over 2 minutes to start to review photos taken when viewing directly from the camera.....seems to be a typical Canon issue as my SX40, SX50 and newest SX60 also had or has this issue too. Night photography is poor and it has a very small CMOS sensor. Also, this camera is rather small and bigger people may have a minor issue handling this camera.
Overall photo quality for outdoor photos without flash ranges from fair to excellent. Low light photos outside with or without flash is poor with this camera. Indoor photos with flash is excellent. This camera has a manually pop up flash built in. Video qualities for all types of videos seems to be very good for this camera.
The camera comes with a Canon battery, charger, strap, lens cap, instruction book & CD plus the camera itself.
It's a decent general purpose digital camera that takes pretty decent photos for the most part."
8242728,19718469,4,True,B00L0XMR8E,Hard to hold still on 30x zoom.
8242729,19718470,5,True,B00L0XMR8E,"Camera is easy to use, lightweight and versatile. My one complaint is that the manual is only available as a downloaded file, and is over 160 pages long!"
8298356,19932884,5,True,B00OVC1UT8,I've been watching this camera for several years.  I finally found a price that I could afford with a lot of extras.  I'm still learning how to take professional looking pictures with it.  My friend that does pro photography said I got a really good camera at a great price.

8378382,20196555,5,True,B00W4E2CGU,It is just like the one I had that had been stolen back in 1995.  I had forgotten how much I loved this camera.  Everything old is new again.  Had a slight problem with original shipment but vendor made it right immediately.  I highly recommend them.

I'd recommend this to anybody who wants to get started with photography or videography though.. Great investment."
9739621,12473362,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Great bundle! The 8gb card was missing, but a quick email to the seller had it sent out and in home in under a week. Everything else was exactly as advertised and the camera is fantastic!"
9739622,12473363,5,True,B00N462AQE,I actually received everything exactly according to the description. I was worried but figured generic accessories weren't a deal breaker. Great bundle for the price! Camera operates perfectly

9739631,12473372,5,True,B00N462AQE,The Canon t5i is a phenomenal camera and this package comes with everything you need and then some. Be prepared to spend time learning the controls. This is nothing like a point and shoot and can be complicated. I found great tutorials on YouTube! Happy with my purchase.

9739636,12473377,3,True,B00N462AQE,This is a great camera! I rated 3 because the 8 GB memory card was missing from the package. Also the mini tripod does not hold up the camera. It's a small detail but a little bummed after the memory card was missing too.
9739637,12473378,5,True,B00N462AQE,I'm so in love with this camera. The picture quality is amazing.  There was an item missing from the original delivery but once I contacted the company they immediately shipped the missing item. Do yourself a favor an make the purchase. U will NOT be disappointed

I'm not a professional by any means and i can take great pictures with this camera.  It's super easy to use and has a ton of features i haven't even tried.  I haven't used all of the accessories like the filters and flash but all the others work great.  Highly recommend this bundle.
9739642,12473383,4,True,B00N462AQE,All products were as described. The bag however had a tear on the inside padding which should have been checked prior to dispatch (hence deducting a star). I used the camera on a recent vacation trip and was happy with the results.

11204534,17537806,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,Impressive service from seller. You cannot tell that the item was refurbished. Looked and worked like brand new. The camera itself is beautiful. It's so much fun to work with.
11204535,17537807,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"You absolutely cannot tell that this is a referb camera and lens.  Works wonderfully and takes great pics.  I picked up the 35mm F2 lens for it and is everything that I wanted.  The jpeg images, especially of people, are so good that post processing is basically a thing of the past.  Saves a ton of time and effort which really makes photography that much more enjoyable.  When you take pictures in raw format there is a huge amount of information in the file for you to work with to draw out details you may want."
11204536,17537808,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,Amazing camera. Functionality perfect.
11204537,17537809,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"Wow, this camera and lens looks and feels brand new! What a great deal!  Better than buying new! Besides no flash and lens hood, the kit comes complete.....I purchased JJC lens hood from amazon for 9.99.  Killer price and quality...!"
11204538,17537810,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"This is one heck of a deal on a great camera. The camera is like new IMO. I should have checked the shutter count before I started using it lol, but it looks just like a new camera. No blemishes or scratches. No issues with operation. It is a great camera and the kit lens is pretty amazing. A full stop or more faster than other kit lenses, but also with an all metal construction that is a few steps above. Optically it is brilliant. Yes you are missing some minor accessories like the lens hood and the flash shoe cover, but you can get the hood for like $9 on ebay or here, and I always pretty much toss the shoe cover anyway. My advice if you are looking at an APS-C sensor camera on a budget is buy this now. This is a pro caliber product at a stupid great price."
11204539,17537811,1,True,B01HDQBSR2,I bought this product from Deal Fisher and received it with the back dial not working. It is also missing accessories. Please contact me to figure out a way to make this right. Thanks!
11204540,17537812,3,True,B01HDQBSR2,"Coming from a Nikon world, the jury is still out after a week of pictures.
But before anything else, BEWARE that the refurbished package does NOT include some key accessories such as a lens hood and complementary flash. It will cost you another $60.00 to get these basics.
The configuration of the camera is quite straight forward when you figure out all the buttons and menu options. The defaults are what you mostly need except for the Sound and Flash OFF that is ON by default - what have they been thinking? Makes it super quiet but without flash!
I mostly shoot Aperture priority (A Mode) with exposure compensation on the front dial, and what was my surprise when I realized that in that mode, the two dials are completely useless and only serve the review of the pictures. They seems to be active only in the other modes. There is no option to redirect the exposure compensation (or anything else) to any dial - once again, what have they been thinking? The upper compensation dial is actually quite hard to turn when you are glued to the EVF to figure out the effect it has - I have big hands also, that does not help. The rear dial is also a little small for my thumb. Fuji definitely needs to talk to the Nikon engineers. The review button is also next to the delete one - maybe not a good idea either.
The EVF is very good (lots of info) and I love having the histogram life. This is really cool. It is getting a little dark in low light but that's ok.
The command pad buttons are terrible but usable with the tip of your finger or nail.
The 1,5 second max review of the picture taken using the back LCD is way to short and forces you to use the review button more than you would like. The picture in RAW are extremely good, even with the kit lens (which is actually very sharp compared to the Nikon kit lenses). I am not sure about the JPEG's which have deep dark shadows that I do not like. You can adjust that through the menu but I do not shoot JPEG, so I don't really care much. The AF system is quite good too for my style - no sport or speedy shooting.
The format is great - bigger than my RX100 but smaller than my D7100. Just about the right size, I think.
So, this guy requires some adjustments if you are use to DSLRs, but overall it is a good buy if you can get it at the right price. I think the X-T2 - my initial choice - is overpriced if it does not drastically improve the T1. This refurbished unit was in perfect condition, so no need to spend more than you have to."
11204541,17537813,4,True,B01HDQBSR2,"Great deal on a great product. Refurbished often equals better/more reliable than buying a brand new camera off the shelf since they have been closely inspected and guaranteed to work. This was definitely a great buy, especially with the lens included. Tempted to buy another to have as back-up.

NOTE: As mentioned by a few reviews on here, there were a few small things missing. There was no lens hood and no hot-shoe cover. I had an extra cover so it didn't bother me and if I decide I REALLY want that lens hood I could probably find it on eBay. However, the seller should at least state these items are missing on the listing."
11204542,17537814,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"The camera is great.  It takes fantastic pictures and the kit lens is probably one of the best you can get (as far as kit lenses are concerned).  It didn't come with a lens hood... but I don't know if the factory kit comes with that or not, so I can't knock the seller for anything.  The seller shipped quickly and the camera/lens came so clean and perfect...  you'd think it was brand spankin new!  I do NOT regret this purchase at ALL.  I love it."
11204543,17537815,3,True,B01HDQBSR2,"My camera came and works perfectly fine, but like another user I also did not receive the EF-X8 Flash. I also did not receive a hood for my 18-55 lens.

Please, if you're going to sell a repackaged item, list everything that will come with it."
11204544,17537816,1,True,B01HDQBSR2,"I recieved the camera without the flash, and also the big issue was to find that the wifi function was not working and make the camera to lock up and freeze. This means that the only way to turn on again is to take the battery out!!!

Unfortunatelly, I'm back to my country and can't return the camera.

Expect this commet helps to take care and check everything as soon as you recieve the XT1."
11204545,17537817,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,Wow... Can not tell this was a refurb camera. Unit came with all original factory sealed refurbished packaging. Not a scratch on the camera or lens. Works perfect. Thanks

11492557,19840254,5,True,B00N462AQE,Amazing package! I received everything in the picture! By far the best thing I have purchased this year!
11492558,19840255,3,True,B00N462AQE,Memory of 8Gb did not arrived
11492559,19840256,5,True,B00N462AQE,"Great kit!  Has everything you'll need for over a year or so.  The wireless flash and remote trigger didn't need any programming they just worked, and they're Polaroid brand not Canon.  Works great, easy to use, would highly recommend.  The tripod is sick and versatile too."
11536701,20060394,5,True,B00S72ZIWI,My daughter loves this camera
11791427,20931429,5,True,B01G2HJSGQ,One of the best SLR body cameras made in 1992.. the PZ1 was designed for a photographer who needed to hold the camera body for hours at a time.
11814251,20987480,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,I love the product since the first moment. It's everything I want and more. Perfect for taking photos traveling or street photography.
11814252,20987481,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,Great camera and lens combo! Probably better than buying new.
11814253,20987482,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"One needs to check all aspects of the camera and lens well. The lens had a defective switch on it, (automatic aperture or not). One needs to find out if everything works before the return period ends. I returned the item via Amazon, even though the seller was accommodating. That way, I could keep the camera body, which I had updated the software, and knew to work well. Too bad for me, the price had increased 30$, but still a great value. For myself, the EVF and manual controls on the camera body are great."
11814254,20987483,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,Great camera takes very nice photos blazing prices was great too
11814255,20987484,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"The X-T1 with XF 18-55mm lens is a great camera kit. Further, when I picked it up from the mail, if I hadn't been told my camera was re-certified I would have thought my camera was brand new. The camera was clean, without any marks of wear, and had all the parts I needed to get going and take great pictures.

The best part about this kit in general is that you're buying a camera that will put out as great a picture as you will let it. The pictures are tack sharp, colorful, and clean from noise."
11814256,20987485,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"Great deal! Very happy with my camera, and the price was fantastic. A practically new X-T1 with the 18-55 for the price of a used X-T1 body. Really enjoying the camera thus far.

Mine came with Fuji refurbished stickers. Very happy."
11814257,20987486,3,True,B01HDQBSR2,"Ad says includes all relevant accessories. they omitted: flash,  hot shoe tab.
negatives for X-T1 over my Sony RX100-II
no in-camera dynamic range possible.
requires almost 3 hand operation... ISO dial needlessly locks, 4-way command dial is difficult to press.
kit lens (while a good lens at only 55m)  doesn't provide enough telephoto distance (for me)
View Mode - EVF has big delay with auto display selection."
11814258,20987487,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,"Like new and a great deal. But pay attention: the box should be completely factory sealed with a Fujifilm sticker. If this is broken or absent, it means the camera was used and returned. My first order I received a camera that was opened and did not have a clean sensor. But I was easily able to exchange for a new one. If you want an X-T1 this is a perfect deal."
12930469,19092667,2,False,B00CAPQ2GY,"A few years ago I bought D-link wireless cameras and their recorder. They worked, a little, but always went off network after a few days. I bought their mid-priced wireless router (860-L), hoping a d-link router would solve my issues, but I found this router to be fast but not reliable. They will help by phone but not for networking their own devices, since on the phone the router person would say, ""you need to call the recorder person for recorder issues."" They're very slow to upgrade when Windows brings out a new version, and their online controller is super-picky about which web browser you use. I'm a retired person, not made of money, so I've stopped even trying to use their security system but I'll keep the router another year or so, but I certainly won't buy another D-link."
12932717,19112728,5,True,B00CJJ1RNE,Camera is easy to use
13128976,20357156,5,True,B011HSC3WG,"The actual camera is not the matt color that showed in the picture. It is glossy and brighter. I still like it tho. Used it many times since I bought it, so far so good."
13307402,20987478,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,This is a great camera!  Very sharp images even at 1/60 of a second even with only 16mp!  It's very light weight and if you put it in full auto mode it could almost be point and shoot!
13307403,20987479,5,True,B01HDQBSR2,Camera was in great condition and has been wonderful so far.
