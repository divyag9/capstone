                        <p class="lead text-left">To get a sense of what information was included and/or mentioned in product reviews, we used Amazon product review datasets as training data.</p>
                        <p class="lead text-left">We recognize a written review differs from a video review in actual content. But we found it helpful to identify product features and associated adjectives that would help our models highlight key terms and their descriptors.</p>
                        <p class="lead text-left">Our process delievered some unexpected challenges, one of them being the fact that product review videos are often delivered in a conversational, off-the-cuff, manner that isn't necessarily organized or concise. A train of thought can pivot, people may forget what they want to say, or they suddenly remember something important even though it's off topic.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">Most know that Amazon is a destination for assessing the pros and cons of products. And review portals, such as Yelp, help many find restaurants and needed services.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">Over the past decade, online reviews have come under fire for their legitimacy. Amazon and Yelp have both tried to address the issues. But skepticism is increasing regarding authenticity.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">In the last several years, video product reviews have become part of the pre-purchase product review process by many consumers. Seeing a person talk about a product connotes a sense of trust that the anonymity of a written post doesn't have. And while thousands of product review videos may exist for products like iPhones, key influencers, as well as trusted Vloggers can have a profound effect on purchase decisions.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">The more we read about the popularity of product review videos, and discussed our own frustrations (mostly the time committment -- after all, who watches just one?), we felt a product that summarizes and highlights the key points would benefit not only consumers, but businesses as well. Marketing and product managers can benefit from using the tool to easily find out what influencers are saying about their product.</p>
