                As of 2019, online product reviews influence the purchase decisions for 93% of consumers.[1] An astute product or marketing manager would not take this statistic lightly. Further investigation into the reputation for the sources of online reviews and the method by which consumers seek out reviews is also critical. For example, Amazon and Yelp have admitted a problem with fake reviews over the past 7 years leading both companies to alter algorithms and file lawsuits against sellers who post fake reviews.[2] 

                And what about video vs. text product reviews? Video product reviews are gaining traction for several reasons. Some claim that watching a person review a product in a video, see their face, and talk about it is easier to trust than anonymously posted comments. And behavioral changes between generations has influenced which categories of videos are most popular on YouTube. Among Millennials and Gen Z, product reviews and unboxing videos fall in the top three categories of watched content on YouTube.[3] 

                All of the above would (hopefully) lead a product and/or marketing manager to want to understand what people are saying about their product in video reviews.

                But who has time to watch hundreds of videos and keep up-to-date on new postings?
