                        <p class="lead text-left">We used two forms of data to build our models: text extracted from product review videos, and Amazon Reviews data.</p>
                        <p class="lead text-left">The Amazon Reviews data helped us get a sense for what information is included in product reviews. While we recognize a written review differs from a produt review, we found it helpful to identify product features and associated adjectives that would help our models highlight key terms and their descriptors.</p>
                        <p class="lead text-left">Our process delievered some unexpected challenges, one of them being that product review videos are often delivered in a conversational, off-the-cuff manner that isn't necessarily organized or concise. A train-of-thought can pivot, people may forget what they want to say, or they suddenly remember something important even though it's off topic.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">Most people know that Amazon is a destination for assessing the pros and cons of products. And review portals, such as Yelp, help many find restaurants and needed services.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">Over the past decade, online written reviews have come under fire for their legitimacy. Amazon and Yelp have both made efforts to address the issues. But skepticism is increasing regarding authenticity.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">Over the last several years, video product reviews have become part of the pre-purchase product review process by many consumers. Seeing a person talk about a product connotes a sense of trust that the anonymity of a written post doesn't have. And while thousands of product review videos may exist for products like iPhones, key influencers, as well as trusted Vloggers, can have a profound effect on purchase decisions.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">But product review videos take time to watch.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">What if there was a tool that provided the pros and cons? Not only could consumers use the tool, product and marketing managers who want to see what is being said about their products could upload "batches" of videos using an API.</p>
