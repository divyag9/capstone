                    <p class="lead text-left">There were many steps and models explored in the creation of Too Long Don't Watch, along with interesting challenges. As a team, we expected product review videos to be more concise, organized, and relatively easy to "process" through machine learning algorithms. Two areas that required significant attention were the lack of punctuation when converting the audio to text, and the conversational nature of the text, with significant filler words, "um's", and jumping back/forth when talking about product features.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">During the early stages of our project, one of the first tasks that needed to be explored was how to extract the audio from a review video and convert it to text.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">Several methods were built including a function that extracted the audio track and then converted the audio track to text, as well as a video caption extractor. The video caption extractor required only one step (vs 5 when first extracting the audio track), so we opted to use the caption extractor. In addition, if a video poster had customized their captions, punctuation was usually included in the output. This proved useful for keyword extraction (discussed later).</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">YouTube auto-captions most videos. And YouTube posters can customize their video captions if desired. This includes adding punctuation. We found that roughly xx% of videos included captions with punctuation. This observation is strictly based on videos we explored for training and testing purposes. For videos whose captions did not include punctuation, we created a algorithm to do it.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">Once we identified our method for extracting the voice-over in the video, we needed to figure out a way to extract keywords. In this case, keywords are defined as product features with an associated decriptor. We built several models as noted below.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">The above example output is from a GoPro review. The output reflects the top ten keywords for each model. We noticed that the majority of keywords are usually in sentences that have a very positive sentiment or very negative sentiment. Rarely do we find keywords in sentences that have a neutral sentiment, or just a slightly positive/negative sentiment. So we implemented a sentiment filter to aid in filtering keywords. The sentiment filter would filter out the less useful sentences prior to keyword extraction.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">To score our models' performance, we developed our own formula. To come up with our own formula, we read through reviews to manually determine appropriate keywords. Our score calculation:</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">Through extensive trial and error, we included the number of predicted keywords in the denominator to help limit the number of keywords being extracted.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-left">Because the sentiment filter removes neutral sentences, as well as slightly positive/negatie sentences, we tested scores with and without the sentiment filter. As seen in the table below, the models performed better with sentiment filter being applied.</p>

                  <p class="lead text-left">In addition to providing color-coded keywords as output, we also thought it would be useful to show the user the entire narrative from the video. In order to do this, we needed to create a statement extractor. This is because many videos do not come with customized captions that include punctuation.</p>
                  <p class="lead text-left">To begin, we manually review the text output and identify is/are statements that are useful for our user. Our code will then implement the following:</p>
                  <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto text-left">
                    <li>Preprocess text to convert “it’s” to “it is”, and “they’re” to “they are”</li>
                    <li>Find “is” or “are” tokens and use Spacy to extract the subtree associated with that token</li>
                    <li>Review all words in the subtree to the left of the token and use POS (noun, adj, etc), TAG (VBN, UH, etc), and DEP (nsubj, expl, etc) to look for the subject of the statement</li>
                    <li>Look words in the subtree to the right of the token and identify the most relevant description using the same method but a different set of rules</li>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p class="lead text-left">The above methods work with text that does not contain punctuation as well, but the rules must be stricter to extract coherent statements. The stricter rules also result in fewer sentences being extracted.</p>
                  <p class="lead text-left">We also created a score formula for sentence extraction. When text output does not include punctuation and stricter rules are required, there are more "missed guesses" which brings down the score. Text output with punctuation performs well.</p>
                  <p class="lead text-left">One interesting note tying back to our initial observations regarding "conversational talk", filler words, and dis-organized flow...if a product review video has a lot of useless is/are statements, our sentence scores may be negatively impacted because of the numerous "useless" sentence guesses in the output.</p>
                  <p class="lead text-left">We also created a formula to score sentence output (below) and calculated the score across several product reviews. It is important to note whether punctuation is included in the output automatically or not as videos including punctuation in the captions were much more easy to identify (as noted above).</p>

The number of Missed Guesses ranged between X%-X% for sentences with punctutation versus X%-X% for sentences without punctuation.</p>
